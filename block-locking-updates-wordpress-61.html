<p>The following features related to block locking were introduced in WordPress 6.1.</p>
<h2 id="block-locking-ui-changes-for-group-block">Block Locking UI Changes for group block</h2>
<p>Locking all children of a group element means that the UI for locking group blocks changed slightly to accomodate the new functionality in blocks that need it.</p>
<p>When locking content in a group or other container, you now have the option of applying the same settings to all the children blocks inside the container</p>

</figure>
<p>Because now we can choose whether to apply the locks to a group’s child elements, there are additional considerations that we need to keep in mind</p>
<h3 id="where-you-make-the-changes-matter">Where you make the changes matter</h3>
<p>If you make the changes to an individual block then the blocks apply only to that block, regardless of the parent container.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you lock the containing group block and apply the lock to all blocks inside, the same settings will be applied to all blocks.</p>

  <figcaption>Block locking UI showing the toggle to apply to all blocks inside the container</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To change the behavior of individual items inside a group, you need to work on the block you want to change individually either in the list view or in the editor.</p>
<h2 id="block-lock-status-in-list-view">Block Lock Status in List View</h2>
<p>You can see whether a block is locked in the list view. Locked blocks have a padlock icon to the right.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>However, we only know that the block is locked. We can’t tell if the block was part of a group block that was locked together with the parent or if it was locked independently.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-for-theme-developers">Benefits for theme developers</h2>
<p>The ability to lock blocks from being moved or deleted presents an interesting possibility.</p>
<p>Locking blocks means that people with less permissions cannot change or remove the locks but they can edit the content of the blocks but not move them or delete them.</p>
<p>There is also an option for <code>content-only editing</code> that would combine locking the status of child blocks with removing styling options. Rich Tabor documents it in <a href="https://richtabor.com/content-only-editing/">How to simplify WordPress patterns with content-only block editing</a> but it is offered as additional material for your review since it’s beyond the scope of this lesson plan.</p>
