<p>Am I the only one who things that tools becoming easier doesn’t mean people will know how to use them and that having easier access to tools may not mean courses that students will be really engaged with?</p>
<p>At least in my experience there were three groups of instructors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technically savy early adopters who have mastered all aspects of the tool and don’t need further support</li>
<li>Early adopters who, while not techically savy, see the advantages of the tool. They haven’t mastered all aspects of the tool but know enough to use it effectively</li>
<li>Late adopters who use the tool because their peers use or because that’s the only way to teach online at their institution</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s the two later groups that worry me. The tool doesn’t offer customizability beyond templates so, my basic question, how do we extend the content we’re creating when we want to distringuish it from other people’s courses on the same subjject?</p>
