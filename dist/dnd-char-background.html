  <p>Liesel grew up the eldest child (4 sibblings) of a merchant and his wife. Life wasn’t always easy for the family as their fortunes were tied to the trading seasons and the profits fluctuated wildly.</p>
<p>He showed up aptitude for magic early on and he was taken as an apprentice by an elderly war wizard who worked him as hard as possible and then some.</p>
<p>As a war wizard he participated in several military campaigns and grew to enjoy using magic to support the front-line grunts that were assigned to him.</p>
<p>It was in one of these missions that his group was ambushed. All the soldiers died (as far as he knows) and he was severely wounded. He was saved by the team sent to reinforce his group, his friends, his family.</p>
<p>After that, he left the military. He couldn’t serve as he was afraid to let his teammates down and be the cause of their deaths. He wondered thorugh the land making his living crafting potions and helping people who needed it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before he ended in Waterdeep.</p>
