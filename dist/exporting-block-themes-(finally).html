  <h1 id="exporting-block-themes-from-the-editor" tabindex="-1">Exporting block themes from the editor</h1>
<p>When the block editor first came out, one of the things I found lacking was the ability to save theme templates and template blocks to files on my computer.</p>
<p>WordPress 6.0 gives developers the ability to export a full theme as a zipped archive.</p>
<p>This feature was first available in version 5.9 but it only allowed you to save the template files. In 6.0 the export feature produces a fully working theme archive that can be imported into another WordPress site or unziped into a directory we can push into a Git repository or to do work in preparation to submit to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">WordPress.org Theme Repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-a-zipped-theme-archive" tabindex="-1">How to create a zipped theme archive</h2>
<p>When using a block theme, we can generate the theme following these steps:</p>
<p>Go to the editor under appearance. From there click the options menu (three vertical dots).</p>
<p>Once you click on the menu you will see several options. Under the <code>Tools</code> group, the first option is <code>Export</code>.</p>

  <figcaption>Theme editor options open. The export option is the first one under tools</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Click on export and choosing the location to save the file to will do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>It will create a zip file to place the content in</li>
<li>Copies all files from the current theme into the zip file</li>
<li>Extracts the template changes that are stored in the database to files and adds them to the zip file
<ol>
<li>If these templates have the same names as those in the theme, they will be overwritten, so that the database version takes precedence</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Adds the theme.json file to the zip file</li>
</ol>
<p>There are three directories that are excluded from the export: <code>.git</code>, <code>node_modules</code> and <code>vendor</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to push the changes to a Git repository you will have to open the zip file and push the content to the repository.</p>
<h2 id="expect-the-unexpected" tabindex="-1">Expect the unexpected</h2>
<p>The export process may make a few unexpected changes to your templates and theme.json files.</p>
<p>Some possible gotchas that need manual editing:</p>
<ol>
<li>The output of template files from the database will be sanitized for security reasons
<ul>
<li>You will likely notice this with any CSS variables in your template files: e.g. <code>--wp--custom--spacing--outer</code> would become <code>\u002d\u002dwp\u002d\u002dcustom\u002d\u002dspacing\u002d\u002douter</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The properties in theme.json are now sorted alphabetically, so you might notice some of the objects in your theme.json moved position in the exported file
<ul>
<li>This now gives us a standard order for these properties so in future it will be easy to know where everything should go</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The schema may be automatically updated to match the version of WordPress you are using
<ul>
<li>Make sure that this update will not break your theme</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="submitting-the-theme-to-the-wordpress-theme-repository" tabindex="-1">Submitting the theme to the WordPress theme repository</h2>
<p>Exporting the file doesn’t mean that it’s ready to submit to the <a href="http://WordPress.org">WordPress.org</a> repository. There are still some steps to complete before it’s ready to submit.</p>
<ol>
<li>If this is the first time you’re submitting the theme, make sure there’s a <code>readme.txt</code> file at the root of the theme
<ul>
<li>This file is required if you will be submitting the theme to the <a href="http://WordPress.org">WordPress.org</a> repository</li>
<li>For an idea of what it should look like, see the <a href="https://github.com/WPTT/sample-theme-readme">Sample Theme Readme</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Update the screenshot if you’ve made any visual changes to the homepage. They should both match</li>
<li>Add a changelog entry to the <code>readme.md</code> file</li>
<li>IF this is not your initial release, you must update the version number of the theme in <code>style.css</code></li>
<li>If your theme is based on an existing theme, you will also need to change the name</li>
<li>If the theme doesn’t have a license file already you will need to add one</li>
<li>Rezip the theme with these changes</li>
<li>The theme is now ready to submit to the <a href="http://WordPress.org">WordPress.org</a> repository for review</li>
</ol>
