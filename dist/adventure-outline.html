  <h1>Adventure outline</h1>
<h2>Notes and initial ideas</h2>
<p>There was a huge war in the world’s distant past.</p>
<p>it was an everything against everything war. Technology, arcane magic, divine magic… whatever you can imagine was part of it. Think of Eberron but with the gods of Exandria thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>The result wasn’t good. The world was almost destroyed.</p>
<p>There were few survivors and most of them chose to forget the disastrous war and forge ahead with their new world, such as it was.</p>
<p>There were a few people on either side of the war that kept the traditions, the magic and the weapons of the past alive. They stayed quiet and kept their knowledge a secret for they knew that if the world found out about the power their wielded the world would hunt them to extinction.</p>
<p>The two surviving factions are the assembly and the marauders.</p>
<p>They’ve waged a secret war for generations. The assembly is trying to avoid the mistakes that led to the war and the marauders are trying to regain power to make sure that the war goes their way this time.</p>
<h2>Session 0: Party creation</h2>
<p>If at all possible bring the players together to create their characters in a <strong>session 0</strong>. This will help the DM steer away form possible problems and encourage players to build relationships between their characters from the beginning.</p>
<h3>Alternative Character Creation</h3>
<p>One way to make sure the party are together is to run something similar to what Fate games do. If you’re so inclined, run something similar to the following section</p>
<ul>
<li>Aspects: Come up with your character’s nature, how she behaves, and her demeanor, what she projects to others
<ul>
<li>These can be the same or they can be different</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Name: Name your character</li>
<li>Class: Choose a class
<ul>
<li>Any from the player’s handbook</li>
<li>From any other source subject to DM’s permission</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phase One: Describe your character’s first adventure
<ul>
<li>Diid he meet any other party members?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phases Two and Three: Describe how you’ve crossed paths with two other characters
<ul>
<li>It may be casual or it may be a long adventure together, but for better or worse you do remember them</li>
<li>depending on your character’s age, you may have gone through more than three phases. Any phase after phase three can include meeting other characters or not</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>DM NOTES</h3>
<p>For purposes of ease of running the game, the races and classes on the Player’s handbook are allowed without restriction, anything else needs DM approval.</p>
<p>Reward creative thinking with additional skills or maybe an inborn ability or a family earloom weapon.</p>
<p>I’ll borrow the idea of the vestiges of divergence from Critical Role to give the party potent artifacts that will grow in power as they do.</p>
<h2><strong>Intro: Getting the party together</strong></h2>
<p>Run a few sessions for the party to get to know each other and build a reputation as individuals and as a group.</p>
<h2><strong>The fun begins</strong></h2>
<p>Depending on the composition, the bar intro may work fine for the party. They get mistaken by someone wanted by the authorities but the real thief raises hell to try and run away… whether she’s successful or not it’s up to what the party does to stop them.</p>
<p>If the bar introduction/fight doesn’t work then have the city watch bring the party to their commander, who will assign them their mission</p>
<p>There will be one extra person in the party. They don’t know who she is but she has been asked to go with you, ostensibly to ensure the party won’t turn sides.</p>
<h3>GM Notes</h3>
<p>Play it mysteriously. If it’s a fight in the bar then the target will try to run away and always seem to be a step beyond the reach of the guards, but not the party. When/if they capture her she’ll be take to the stockade and, perhaps to no one’s surprise, she’ll escape the supposedly escape-proof prison.</p>
<p>If the party was summoned to the guard house, then the news of the thief’s escape will surprise the party but they will be asked to stay in the building while the commander has a conference with the soldiers making the report.</p>
<p>Once the news of the thief’s escape reaches the ears of the guard commander turns to the party</p>
<h2>The mission</h2>
<p>Once the party is together they are brought to the commander’s office for a meeting. The commander is a tall human woman with drak brown hair and eyes that have seen countless deaths.</p>
<p>Read the following to the party:</p>
