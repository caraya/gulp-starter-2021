<p>We have many ways of reading content and they will all be different.</p>
<p>So how to best optimize font size for reading long-form content online?</p>
<p>For this exercise we’ll define three sizes for the content:</p>
<ul>
<li>small: to be read at close distance</li>
<li>medium: our default size to be read while sitting on your desk</li>
<li>large: to be read farther away than medium or in larger screens</li>
</ul>
<p>For the sake of experimentation I’ve chosen the following sizes</p>
<ul>
<li>small: 12 points</li>
<li>medium: 16 points</li>
<li>large: 24 points</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is that the farther away we are reading from the larger we make the body font size to account for the distance. It is different to read on a tablet while in bed than it is reading from your laptop screen or a larger computer monitor.</p>
<p>Points are slightly larger than pixels when used for screen measurements:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 pixel (px) is usually measured as 1/96th of an inch</li>
<li>1 point (pt) is measured as 1/72nd of an inch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore 16px = 12pt.</p>
<p>The first iteration of these settings are static. They are radio buttons that will change the values.</p>
<p>In a future iteration I would look at turning it into a slider to give the user more control over the font sizes available.</p>
