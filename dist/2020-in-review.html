  <h1>2020 in review</h1>
<p>Can we just get the <strong>OMG, what a clusterfuck</strong> out of the way first?</p>
<p>The clusterfuck for me has been at serveral levels. Some of them seem obvious but some of them touch deep and others come and go.</p>
<p>There are 4 touch points throughout the year, all associated with events that I did, that happened to me or that happened to people who were important to me. If you’ve read any of my previous touchpoints, you know what they are</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3/27</strong> When I arrived in the US, 1994</li>
<li><strong>6/18</strong> Dad’s birthday</li>
<li><strong>9/25</strong> My birthday</li>
<li><strong>12/22-31</strong> Dad’s passing and end-of-year review</li>
</ul>
<p>But this year has been hit with additional shit like COVID and its closing everything down; it has been insanely hard to stay motivated to continue job hunting and it’s only been the promise of what I can do after having a job for a while that’s made me continue working on it; it’s the realization that I’m getting old; But I think the most important thing that hit me this year is that I’m not sure if I did the right thing the multiple times I decided to stay in the US both as a resident and the as a naturalized citizen.</p>
<p>When I first came to the US, I did so with a residence visa that would have been good enough to stay as long as I wanted to. Maybe naively, I thought I would stay long enough to finish my undergraduate and then go back. That wasn’t the case (and I wonder if I knew that before I left)… it wasn’t long after I arrived on Burlington I decided I’d stay in the US. Then in '98 when I finished at Central, I evaluated again if I wanted to stay, I did. Finally, after having the discussion with mom that things were about to get dicey for residents after 9/11, I decided to apply for naturalization and I completed the process in '04 (this was one of the reasons why I couldn’t fly to be with dad when he passed away).</p>
<p>I always thought I did the right thing because I wasn’t going back to Chile (at some points I thought I wouldn’t even go for a visit after the 1999/2000 experience). The older I get the less confident I am about those decisions and about not wanting to go back to Chile.</p>
<p>It’s true that I don’t really know anyone and it’s true that I’ve never felt I belonged there. It is also true that there are things I want to do and I can only do them there. That’s where Neruda’s houses are. That’s where the last remaining family on my dad’s side is. I’ve tried to convince myself that being a tourist in Chile wouldn’t be such a bad thing but beyond that there’s another truth… I’ve never lived there as an adult and I’ve started to wonder what it would be like.</p>
<p>SO the plan is to work for the next 12 to 30 months (or as long as the contract will keep me) and then spend time abroad:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 to 12 months in Santiago
<ul>
<li>commit to 6 months and then plan for another 6 if things work out)…
<ul>
<li>long enough to cleanup the remaining family mess but not long enough to make me regret the choice</li>
<li>time to create and do projects that have been on my mind a lot lately</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3 months in Donostia San Sebastián, in the Basque country to relax and do genealogy research on my dad’s side of the family</li>
<li>3 months in southern Spain, looking for a place to learn flamenco or just wondering around</li>
<li>3 months as a Eurail Pass traveler to wonder around continental Europe and not have to worry about places to stay every time I get off the train, just get back on the train for another overnighter :D</li>
<li>3 months to travel around England, Scotland and Ireland</li>
<li>If there is budget for a year 3 or if we can make it happen at a later date, then spend it learning how to do Japanese weaponsmithing at <a href="https://dragonflyforge.com/">Dragonfly Forge</a> in Oregon</li>
</ul>
<p>Going back to Chile is scary in so many levels. It’s starting from scratch, it’s learning a place and a culture that I should be familiar with, but I’m not. It is also coming to terms with the choices I made, one way or another, and learning to live with the consequences.</p>
<p>Another big question is <strong><em>Am I ready to put myself out there to seek a relationship and get hurt in the process?</em></strong> Am I willing to do so?</p>
<p>At what point does self-preservation becomes an exercise in futility and how much more does it hinder and hurt you than it helps? At what point is it just fear of rejection and fear of getting hurt that speaks and couches it as self preservation. Can you separate one from the other?</p>
<p>Found this song in YouTube, from Step Up Revolution, of all places. For some reason, don’t know why, it just spoke to me and made me ask the question again but from a different perspective this time… one of those that makes you uncomfortable because you know it’ll make you think about things and people that you know you’ve been avoiding for a while or who you know you won’t be able to find again.</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">There is a house built out of stone
Wooden floors, walls and window sills
Tables and chairs worn by all of the dust
This is a place where I don't feel alone
This is a place where I feel at home

Cause, I built a home
For you
For me

Until it disappeared
From me
From you

And now, it's time to leave and turn to dust

Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
There is a tree as old as me
Branches were sewn by the color of green
Ground had arose and passed it's knees

By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top
I climbed the tree to see the world
When the gusts of wind came around to blow me down
I held on as tightly as you held onto me
I held on as tightly as you held onto me

Cause, I built a home
For you
For me

Until it disappeared
From me
From you

And now, it's time to leave and turn to dust

<p>A big thing for 2021 is to listen to my instincts and let them lead for a while. It’s not certain that the plans I laid out here today will be the same plans I have this time next year… and that’s ok… but until, and unless, they change they give me a direction to work towards and goals to achieve</p>

<p>The past is gone and will never come back, right? I think the last reflection I want for 2020 is to ask that question… people who meant a lot to me and disappeared. I think I’ve found some of them but I’m not sure and I’m not certain I want to dredge things out from the box, at least not without a good reason. is my own peace of mind a good enough reason? To make sure they are OK and to catch up?</p>
