<blockquote>
<p>If home is where the heart is, then where is home?</p>
<p>me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I get ready to start the 44th trip around the sun there are many things that come crashing down and around me to make evaluate life, present and future more closely than I would normally do as the priorities, wishes, desires and obsessions work around and inside me.</p>
<p>There are three areeas driving the reflections this time... maybe new, maybe not.  Travel, self sustenance while I travel, and what am I planning to do moving forward...</p>
<pre><code>Mission
Rush (Hold Your Fire)

Hold your fire
Keep it burning bright
Hold the flame
'Til the dream ignites
A spirit with a vision
Is a dream with a mission
I hear their passionate music
Read the words
That touch my heart
I gaze at their feverish pictures
The secrets that set them apart
When I feel the powerful visions
Their fire has made alive
I wish I had that instinct
I wish I had that drive
Spirits fly on dangerous missions
Imaginations on fire
Focused high on soaring ambitions
Consumed in a single desire
In the grip of
A nameless possession
A slave to the drive of obsession
A spirit with a vision
Is a dream with a mission
I watch their images flicker
Bringing light to a lifeless screen
I walk through
Their beautiful buildings
And I wish I had their dreams
But dreams don't need
To have motion
To keep their spark alive
Obsession has to have action
Pride turns on the drive
It's cold comfort
To the ones without it
To know how they struggled
How they suffered about it
If their lives were
Exotic and strange
They would likely have
Gladly exchanged them
For something a little more plain
Maybe something a little more sane
We each pay a fabulous price
For our visions of paradise
But a spirit with a vision
Is a dream with a mission

<p>I think I screwed up royally when I left Google last year.  Part of me thinks that it would have been better to cancel the trip and not go and just keep working but the other part remembers how exhausted I was after the second trip to London.</p>
<p>Second guessing yourself is easy, you're good at it. But whateveer the decision I should have taken was it's already taken and I gotta live with it.  What reaally killed me is that I didn't get to travel at all this year... after Amsterdam and London I kept thinking that it would be possible to do it no matter what... and then reality has been bitch slapping me ever since.</p>
<pre><code>Prime Mover
Rush
Basic elemental
Instinct to survive
Stirs the higher passions
Thrill to be alive
Alternating currents
In a tidewater surge
Rational resistance
To an unwise urge
Anything can happen
From the point of conception
To the moment of truth
At the point of surrender
To the burden of proof
From the point of ignition
To the final drive
The point of the journey
Is not to arrive
Anything can happen
Basic temperamental
Filters on our eyes
Alter our perceptions
Lenses polarize
Alternating currents
Force a show of hands
Rational responses
Force a change of plans
Anything can happen
From a point on the compass
To magnetic north
The point of the needle
Moving back and forth
From the point of entry
Until the candle is burned
The point of departure
Is not to return
Anything can happen
I set the wheels in motion
Turn up all the machines
Activate the programs
And run behind the scene
I set the clouds in motion
Turn up light and sound
Activate the window
And watch the world go round
Anything can happen
</code></pre>
<p>I've also been ambivalent about what to do to move forward</p>
