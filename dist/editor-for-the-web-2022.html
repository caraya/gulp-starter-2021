<p>I’m still looking for a good toolkit to build an editor around. Most of the solutions I’ve looked at have some sort of drawback that made me drop them from the project.</p>
<p>Even though it’s in beta, <a href="https://stylojs.com/">Stylo.js</a> may be the best solution I’ve found so far but I can’t create a menu for it (it apears as just a plus signs on the side), so that disaqualifies it from being the solution that we want to use.</p>
<p>I cam across a <a href="https://github.com/code-farmer-i/vue-markdown-editor">Vue Markdown Editor</a> that sounds interesting enough to take a further look.</p>
<p>The editor is a Vue component that makes a full Code Mirror based editor for your application.</p>
<p>It looks exactly like what I need but it has the same problem as with ProseMirror. The developers assume that you know how to build a component with Vue and skip any of the basic setup.</p>
<p>I can probably figure Vue components out but it seems like a lot of work.</p>
<p>I started with the <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/">Vue CLI</a> to automate the configuration and setup of the project at the cost of flexibility, like many</p>
