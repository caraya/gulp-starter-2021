  <h1 id="a-new-baseline-for-front-end-development">A new baseline for front-end development</h1>
<p>In 2012 Rebeca Murphey wrote <a href="http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/04/12/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers">A baseline for front-end developers</a> as a minimum of what people should know to work in front-end development back in the day.</p>
<p>I went back to the article and was surprised at how well it holds up 7 years after it was written; the tools may have changed but we need to keep the discussion going. What does it take to do front-end development in 2019? What tools we need to do it?.</p>
<h2 id="javascript">Javascript</h2>
<p>I won't advocate specific frameworks or technologies. I believe we should all start from a basic understanding of the language in question so we can build basic interactivity and move to advanced concepts and frameworks at a later time.</p>
<p>If you need to work through some of the basics these are some good resources</p>
<p><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net">Eloquent Javascript</a>: A wonderful book (also available as a PDF, an EPUB and a print purchase) that takes you back to JavaScript basics without being overbearing.</p>
<p>While Eloquent Javascript provides a strong foundation it doesn't cover all the changes brought into the language in newer versions. <a href="https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/index.html">JavaScript for impatient programmers</a> provides a more recent introductory Javascript text, covering the language until its more recent update (ES2019). It also skips portions of the language that only work in the browser.</p>
<p>If you feel like you have a good background in the lnaguage, <a href="https://exploringjs.com/es6.html">Exploring ES6</a> and the updates <a href="https://exploringjs.com/es2016-es2017.html">Exploring ES2016 and 2017</a> and <a href="https://exploringjs.com/es2018-es2019/">Exploring ES2018 and ES2019</a> provide information only on the new feaatures released in those version of the language specification.</p>
<h3 id="babel">Babel</h3>
<p>Front end developers should know what Babel is, how it works and how to use it to create bundles based on what the browser supports using the <code>babel-env</code> plugin.</p>
<p>Anothe important thing to know when working with Babel is how to build a Babel configuration file to convert modern ES2015+ so it will run in current browsers.</p>
<p>For a refresher I suggest <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/babel/">A short and simple guide to Babel</a></p>
<h2 id="css-and-pre-processors">CSS and pre-processors</h2>
<p>CSS Preprocessors like <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> and <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a>, <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> (and their associated libraries like <a href="https://www.bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a> <a href="https://neat.bourbon.io/">Neat</a>, <a href="http://bitters.bourbon.io/">Bitters</a>, and others) and post processors like <a href="https://postcss.org/">PostCSS</a> have greatly improved the way we work with CSS but whatever tool we use, we need to remember that we still need to know our CSS basics... none of the tools will build CSS for us, they will only enhance what's already there.</p>
<p>Sites like MDN's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS">Learn to style HTML using CSS</a> are a good starting point for learning the what and the how about CSS.</p>
<p>The last thing in this area is to know about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix">vendor prefixes</a>, what they are, how they work and how to implement them with tools like <a href="https://css-tricks.com/autoprefixer/">Autoprefixer</a>.</p>
<h2 id="modularity">Modularity</h2>
<p>The way we create modular content has changed. From AMD and CommonJS we're moving to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS">CommonJS</a> in Node.js and <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/">ES native modules</a> and, some time in the not so distant future, to native ES Modules alone.</p>
<p>As front end developers we should be aware of the differences between Common JS and ES Modules, where and when we would use each of them.</p>
<p>We should learn how to optimize loading of production code using <a href="https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/">differential loading</a>.</p>
<p>Understand what the following snippet does</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token operator">&lt;</span>script type<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"module"</span> src<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"myModules.js"</span><span class="token operator">></span><span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>script<span class="token operator">></span>
<span class="token operator">&lt;</span>script nomodule src<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"myScript.js"</span> defer<span class="token operator">></span><span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>script<span class="token operator">></span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="git-and-github">Git and Github</h2>
<p>Most development happens in Git repositories, either private, hosted on Gitlab or hosted on Github (who has lost users since the Microsoft acquisition1).</p>
<p>Git has become essential to development, either front-end or backend so we need to know the basics of how the software works.</p>
<p>Some suggested starting points.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create repositories in your local machine and on your Git host</li>
<li>Set your local git repostory to sync with a remote Git server like Github, Gitlab or another Git host</li>
<li>Create and use a <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">branching strategy</a> for your team to collaborate in a project</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty of resources for working with Git.</p>
<ul>
<li>The book <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</a> is available under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons</a> license</li>
<li>Github Resources
<ul>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/">Git Handbook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf">Git Cheatsheet</a></li>

<h2 id="build-and-process-automation">Build and Process Automation</h2>
<p>Building our web content has gotten more complicated both in terms of what we're requiring our build systems to do and the number of build systems available on the market.</p>
<p>Pick a system and learn it well enough so you can use it to build the tooling that you need for your projects.</p>
<p>Understand the <a href="https://scotch.io/@VitalyKuprenko/grunt-vs-gulp-vs-webpack-an-elaborate-comparison-of-tools">differences and similarities</a> between build systems like Gulp, Grunt and others versus bundlers like WebPack and RollUp and when would you use one or the other.</p>
<p>Mulyana's <a href="https://mulyana.me/gulp-4-tutorial/">Gulp 4 tutorial</a> provides both a good overview of how to implement plugins and an example of the varied things you can do with the tool</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/webpack/">Web Performance Optimization with webpack</a> series gives you a good starting point for how to use Webpack.</p>
<h2 id="browser-dev-tools">Browser Dev Tools</h2>
<p>The developer tools built into modern browsers give you a lot of power to inspect your site/app. Learn what DevTools can do and how to best use them... for example, learn how to use DevTools to debug a web application on a device.</p>
<p>Different browsers DevTools have different areas where they excel so it pays to learn what the differences are and what areas where each of them excels (if any).</p>
<p>Chrome has a particularly good <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/progressive-web-apps">PWA</a> debugging and give you an easier way to clean up the content of your caches when you're testing your application.</p>
<p>Firefox <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Examine_grid_layouts">CSS Grid Inspector</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Edit_CSS_shapes">Shapes Editor</a> make it easier for you to work with the respective items.</p>
<p>Here's some information for each browser's DevTools</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwUNifZ4WrY&amp;list=PLo3w8EB99pqLZNY22xKbTEzMfYo9PXAlm">Chrome DevTools 101</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwUNifZ4WrY&amp;list=PLo3w8EB99pqLZNY22xKbTEzMfYo9PXAlm">Firefox DevTools</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h-bqUNNHZE">Safari browser for developers</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="your-web-server-matters">Your web server matters</h2>
<p>The web server we use to serve our content may also have an impact on how we buildand package our content. Be aware of the differences between HTTP1.1 and http2 in terms of performance and how it changes the way we package and deliver our front end content.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/02/getting-ready-for-http2/">Getting Ready For HTTP2: A Guide For Web Designers And Developers</a>, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r7QXGYOLCh4fcUq0jDdDwKJWNqWK1o4xMtYpKZCJYjM/present?slide=id.p19">HTTP2 is here, let's optimize</a> for starting points in understanding the differences and how they affect front end practices.</p>
