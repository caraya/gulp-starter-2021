  <h1 id="the-toast-debacle">The toast debacle</h1>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2019/07/is-google-toast/">Ezequie Bruni</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On June 12th, 2019, Google developers asked for a review of a proposed new element for HTML. Specifically, they asked the Web Platform Incubator Community Group (WICG), a community dedicated to fostering open discussion about the future of the Internet as a platform. It’s run by the W3C, and generally, it’s exactly where you should be asking about potential changes to the actual foundation of the Internet.</p>
<p>On the same day, however, they announced their intent to include the element in the Blink rendering engine. Now, that doesn’t mean it’s going to happen any time soon, but it caused some significant consternation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rings true if you think that the email to blink-dev indicates something is a done deal; it’s far from it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.chromium.org/blink/launching-features">Chromium New Feature launch process</a> gives a more nuanced view of what it takes to develop a feature that will be available in Chrome and active by default.</p>
<p><a href="https://adactio.com/journal/15357">Jeremy Keith</a> provides a more nuanced analysis of the issue</p>
