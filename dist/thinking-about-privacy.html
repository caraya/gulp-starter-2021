  <h1>Plugin Topics: Thinking about privacy</h1>
<p>Privacy in the context of a web application like WordPress goes beyond legal requirements. It’s also answering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What information we collect</li>
<li>Why we collect it</li>
<li>How we use it</li>
<li>how we protect it</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken from <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/45123.html">ISO 29100/Privacy Framework standard</a>, the following checklist provides a good starting point for thinking about privacy in general but more applicable in the context of a WordPress plugin that collects data from users and uses that data to create a service or site:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consent and choice</strong>: giving users (and site visitors) choices and options over the uses of their data, and requiring clear, specific, and informed opt-in;</li>
<li><strong>Purpose legitimacy and specification</strong>: only collect and use the personal data for the purpose it was intended for, and for which the user was clearly informed of in advance;</li>
<li><strong>Collection limitation</strong>: only collect the user data which is needed; don’t make extra copies of data or combine your data with data from other plugins if you can avoid it</li>
<li><strong>Data minimization</strong>: restrict the processing of data, as well as the number of people who have access to it, to the minimum uses and people necessary;</li>
<li><strong>Use, retention and disclosure limitation</strong>: delete data which is no longer needed, both in active use and in archives, by both the recipient and any third parties;</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy and quality</strong>: ensure that the data collected and used is correct, relevant, and up-to-date, especially if inaccurate or poor data could adversely impact the user;</li>
<li><strong>Openness, transparency and notice</strong>: inform users how their data is being collected, used, and shared, as well as any rights they have over those uses;</li>
<li><strong>Individual participation and access</strong>: give users a means to access or download their data;</li>
<li><strong>Accountability</strong>: documenting the uses of data, protecting it in transit and in use by third parties, and preventing misuse and breaches as much as is possible;</li>
<li><strong>Information security</strong>: protecting data through appropriate technical and security measures;</li>
<li><strong>Privacy compliance</strong>: ensuring that the work meets the privacy regulations of the location where it will be used to collect and process people’s data.</li>
</ul>
<p>While not all of these principles will be applicable across all situations and uses, using them in your plugin development process can help to ensure user trust.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/privacy/#food-for-thought-for-your-plugin">Food for Thought for Your Plugin</a>, the WordPress theme provides a privacy checklist for you to use when planning your plugin and this is WordPress specific:</p>
<ol>
<li>How does your plugin handle personal data?
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_add_privacy_policy_content/">wp_add_privacy_policy_content</a> to disclose to your users any of the following:
<ul>
<li>Does the plugin share personal data with third parties (e.g. to outside APIs/servers)
<ul>
<li>If so, what data does it share with which third parties</li>
<li>Do the third partieshave a published privacy policy you can link to?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the plugin collect personal data?
<ul>
<li>If so, what data and where is it stored?</li>
<li>Think about places like user data/meta, options, post meta, custom tables, files, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the plugin use personal data collected by others?
<ul>
<li>If so, what data?</li>
<li>Does the plugin pass personal data to a SDK?</li>
<li>What does that SDK do with the data?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the plugin collect telemetry data, directly or indirectly? Loading an image from a third-party source on every install, for example, could indirectly log and track the usage data of all of your plugin installs.</li>
<li>Does the plugin enqueue Javascript, tracking pixels or embed iframes from a third party?</li>
<li>Does the plugin store things in the browser?
<ul>
<li>If so, where and what? Think about things like cookies, local storage, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your plugin collects personal data…
<ul>
<li>Does it provide a personal data exporter?</li>
<li>Does it provide a personal data eraser callback?</li>
<li>For what reasons (if any) does the plugin refuse to erase personal data? (e.g. order not yet completed, etc) — those should be disclosed as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the plugin use error logging?
<ul>
<li>Does it avoid logging personal data if possible?</li>
<li>Could you use things like <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_add_privacy_policy_content/">wp_privacy_anonymize_data</a> to minimize the personal data logged?</li>
<li>How long are log entries kept? Who has access to them?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In wp-admin:
<ul>
<li>what role/capabilities are required to access/see personal data?</li>
<li>Are they sufficient?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What personal data is exposed on the front end of the site by the plugin?
<ul>
<li>Does it appear to logged-in and logged-out users?</li>
<li>Should it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What personal data is exposed in REST API endpoints by the plugin?
<ul>
<li>Does it appear to logged-in and logged-out users?</li>
<li>What roles/capabilities are required to see it? Are those appropriate?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the plugin properly remove/clean-up data, including especially personal data:
<ul>
<li>During uninstall of the plugin?</li>
<li>When an related item is deleted (e.g. from the post meta or any post-referencing rows in another table)?</li>
<li>When a user is deleted (e.g. from any user referencing rows in a table)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the plugin provide controls to reduce the amount of personal data required?</li>
<li>Does the plugin share personal data with SDKs or APIs only when the SDK or API requires it, or is the plugin also sharing personal data that is optional?</li>
<li>Does the amount of personal data collected or shared by this plugin change when certain other plugins are also installed?</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s a lot to think about when it comes to WordPress, privacy and using third party plugins. If you’re in doubt your best bet is always to ask a lawyer, preferably one with experience in privacy and its legal requirements.</p>
