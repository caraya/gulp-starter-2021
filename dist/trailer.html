  <p>A little “teaser trailer” of the Season 5 open here.   In the tradition of those quickie little trailers we all sit through in the theaters (in happier days before isolation).</p>
<p>A vision of Cain in the S4 ender leads the Galactica to get themselves prepared for a message they never expected to hear:</p>
<p>No one who was on the Bridge would ever forget what they were thinking or doing when the long centars of silent waiting and wondering finally came to an end. Almost all of them had expected it to come with a change in Athena’s body language or bearing.   That was why they kept sneaking looks up at her, seeing if there was any sign that it was finally happening.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t those sneaking glances at Athena who got the first indication. Instead it was Omega. Reliable, unexcitable, efficient Omega who experienced the first indication   because he’d been keyed in to monitor scan readings on the Baseship at that particular instant.</p>
<p>“Colonel Tigh!” he’d bolted up, his voice at a higher level than anyone who’d known him had ever heard. “The Baseship is registering a distinct power level drop!”</p>
<p>A loud murmur erupted from all corners of the Bridge, and now every head was trained on the upper level.    After many long centars of vigil, Athena had sprung forward in her chair and was aggressively making adjustments to the monitor in front of her.</p>
<p>Behind her, the Executive Officer, in response to all the frenzied chatter that erupted, gave out a command louder than he did when sounding Battle Stations, “Quiet! QUIET!     Anyone who talks is on REPORT!”</p>
<p>Like a curtain rapidly descending, the chattering stopped.   And now, no one even dared to make a whisper as all the eyes remained trained on Athena.</p>
<p>She could see in front of her, the screen that had been blank all this time suddenly coming to life.     First, it was just a bright wall of white that bent slightly in the middle.   But then… it formed to an image of crystal clarity.</p>
<p>No matter how much Athena’s mind had tried to condition herself to the idea, there was still a feeling of numb shock in every part of her body. As though the part of her that had lost all faith in miracles following the Destruction was trying to make some protesting assertion that what she saw in front of her on the monitor couldn’t possibly be real. But nonetheless, it was there. The image of a woman who looked as if she might have been in her early to mid-forties had Athena not known the true age was more than ten yahrens older.      Dressed in a conservative style green and white tunic reminiscent of what female Council members wore.    Her darkish blonde hair styled elegantly, showing a few silver streaks on the side. Her face… an older version of Athena’s with the same blue eyes that opened to wide-eyed wonder as it became clear that she could see her.</p>
<p>“Mother… ?” Athena could barely force the word out.</p>
<p>Ila’s face broke into a warm, maternal smile.</p>
<p>“Hello, Sunshine,” her voice came through clearly.   “I’ve missed you so.”</p>
