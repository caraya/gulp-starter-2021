  <p>I find it amazing (and not in a good way) that the supreme court has found in favor of the administration in allowing the Muslim Ban to proceed, even in a softer iteration than it originally was written. The full text of the ban that passed muster with SCOTUS is in this <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/text-of-trump-executive-order-nation-ban-refugees/index.html">CNN article</a>.</p>
<p>It is hard for me to believe that 5 of the best jurists in this country couldn’t see the animus of “el presidente” and his cronies against Muslims before the election and, particularly, since it happened.</p>
<p>Justices Sotomaryor and Ginsburg referenced the Korematsu case in their dissent from the majority in the “Travel Ban” case. It’s interesting to see why and what was the situation in that case.</p>
<p>Korematsu originated as a response to <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Executive_Order_9066">Executive Order 9066</a> that allowed the internment of Japanese American citizens during war time.  It was one of three cases related to the executive order that made it to the Supreme Court. The cases were (in chronological and severity order):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Yasui_v._United_States">Yasui v. United States (1943)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hirabayashi_v._United_States">Hirabayashi v. United States (1943)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Korematsu_v._United_States">Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you see read the cases you will see a parallel with today’s case. There was fear, people lied about facts on the case and suppressed intelligence on the matter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the case [Korematsu], Solicitor General Charles Fahy is alleged to have suppressed evidence by keeping from the Court a report from the Office of Naval Intelligence that there was no evidence that Japanese Americans were acting as spies or sending signals to enemy submarines.[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and otherwise let their animosity towards the Japanese color their actions and affected the lives of thousands if not hundreds thousands of Americans whose only fault was being born Japanese or been born to Japanese.</p>
<p>It is also sad that the Santayana maxim: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it” holds true now more than ever.</p>
<p>A president says things about a religious groups should worry you. There is no verification of facts, there is no concession that any kind of vetting will only be as effective as it is intrusive in the lives of the people coming into the country and their families who choose to stay there.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the vetting, the closing of the borders and the animosity against Muslims is done on national security ground, promising that it’ll keep America safe from terrorists and other adverse results.</p>
<p>It is extremely sad to see how we got here over the past few years and scary as hell to see where we are headed (No, don’t have a crystal ball but you don’t need one to see the evolution of this clusterfuck). This is not a new policy; as the tweets above show there has been an animosity towards refugees in general and particularly from those 7 countries.</p>
<p>I’m afraid that the travel ban will havea diametrically opposite effect to keeping America safe. ISIS can now point to the travel ban as further proof that America hates muslims and that they should all fight against the American devil.  Intelligence agencies will have a much harder time to recruit local human intelligence assets and support personnel: the earlier because why should they help the people who hate them so much and the latter because any attempt at collaborating with the enemy will be seen as betrayal.</p>
<p>When we turn our heads towards undocumented immigrants and those seeking asylum</p>
