<p>I grew up playing video games. Now I live my life inside one. That’s why I feel qualified to say that Kira Underwood was right, when she said that life was like an extremely difficult, horribly unbalanced videogame. But sometimes the game can have a surprise ending…</p>
<p>And sometimes, when you think you’ve finally reached the end of the game, you find yourself standing at the start of a whole new level. A level that you’ve neveer seen before.</p>
<p>And the only thing you can do is keep right on playing. Because the game that is your life isn’t over yet. And there’s no teelling how far you might be able to get, what you may discover, or who you might meet when you get there.</p>
