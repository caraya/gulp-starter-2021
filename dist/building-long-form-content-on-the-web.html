<p>It’s been a while since I’ve researched and written about long-form content for the web.</p>
<p>New technologies and APIs make it easier to create contet that is a far cry from <a href="https://craigmod.com/bibliotype/">Bibliotype</a>.</p>
<p>Bibliotype is a project from Craig Mod aimed at creating long-form reading experiences for iPads (at the time the project was developed there were no Android tablets).</p>
<p>But now we have technologies that make the whole concept of a Bibliotype-like page easier to implement. There are also web technologies that were not available ten years ago to make it even more interesting to explore and implement now.</p>
<p>This series of posts will look at some technical and typographical aspects necessary to create long-form content that is comfortable to read from a screen.</p>
<p>The posts will not deal with <strong>how</strong> people read online. Hopefully, by using the techniques in this series we’ll create better experiences for people to want to read online.</p>
