  <p>Education is definitely a solid piece of the puzzle. Prison reform as well. To many single family homes. The public school system is a joke and I’m only one year into it with our teenager. She is half black/half Hispanic and the racism she has faced is sad.</p>
<p>In our brainstorming session it seemed like digging into local government and beginning the process of removing the white man in power and replace with a diverse population of females would be helpful. Too many white men in power everywhere.</p>
<p>And most white men are not awesome. That was one piece and what infuriated me is the white right Christian women voting on one topic which is total garbage and a sell out. You want to end abortion then you need white men/men to keep their hands to themselves and have legit jail time instead of a slap on the wrist. Remove the sexualized culture. Most women having abortions are part of the #metoo movement. Christian white woman should be in an uproar about racism but they aren’t. Why? They are now clinging to Sex trafficking…ok, and who are most likely to end up being trafficked? People of color looking for a way out. We’ve been doing work in the foster care system which is broken but people will throw money at animal rights but not at the kids in need. Why? In my opinion it’s a heart condition. So how do we stir the heart enough to care and recognize it’s everyone’s work to do, not just the oppressed. It’s all so interconnected which then becomes overwhelming and people shy away from the work. Christians are called to be like Jesus and most Christians couldn’t be further from Him. He was for the orphans, widows and oppressed. Not white suburban comfortable Pharisees. I’m rambling.</p>
