  <h1 id="tired" tabindex="-1">tired</h1>
<p>I gotta say something I never thought I would</p>
<p>I’m emotionally and spiritually tired.</p>
<p>I’m tired of trying to figure out where the next attack will come from and whether my “brothers and sisters” will defend people like me from the next attack, or the one after that or the next one. I’m tired of only seeing the Trump supportes in the christian world be the ones who speak and the ones that fade quietly to obscurity when their misdeeds are found and made public.</p>
<p>The straw that broke the camel’s back was hearing Karen Tsai say “The only thing that matters is who gets to select the next justice of the supreme court” before the last election and how much her echo chamber agreed without even thinking about the consequences.</p>
<p>The issue is that they will never have to deal with the consequences of their decisions, that’s for others who, like me, are dreading losing access to healthcare with a repeal of the ACA without an alternative that includes protection of pre-existig conditions, people like me who will be denied asylum and who will likely die in their home countries.</p>
<p>Wasn’t the newest comandment in the New Testament to love one another as Jesus loved you? He didn’t put conditions for his love. He didn’t save love one another as long as you look the same or have the same views on same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>I don’t see that. I see a group of people trying to hold on to some kind of power to make themselves relevant in a world that is rapidly forgetting them.</p>
<p>I am done trying to reconcile what the church and people on the church say versus what they do. If it means I’m no longer a part of that organization then so be it. I can live with that</p>
