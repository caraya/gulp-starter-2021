<p>My educational background is in anthropology as an undergrad and instructional design and technology as a graduate student. To that with 24 years of playing around on the web. This helps frame the next sections.</p>
<p>Most of my curriculum development work has been to bring people into technology, from teacing community college and university faculty how to put courses online in the late 90s to building ILT curriculum to bring developers into working with PWAs.</p>
<p>Some things that I’ve observed of my own training and those of others and from Codebar’s <a href="https://codebar.io/effective-teacher-guide">Coaches Guide</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not take over the keyboard without asking!</li>
<li>Explain that there are no dumb questions</li>
<li>Explain to students that it’s OK to make mistakes</li>
<li>Always introduce yourself, why are you there and what experience do you bring to the table.</li>
<li>Give your students the opportunity to get to know each other. Always do a round of introductions before starting</li>
<li>Assume that anyone you’re teaching has no knowledge but infinite intelligence</li>
<li>Take it slow, you are the teacher, they are the student. Allow for time between questions</li>
</ul>
