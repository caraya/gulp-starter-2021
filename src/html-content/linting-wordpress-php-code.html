<h1 id="linting-wordpress-php-code">Linting WordPress PHP code</h1>
<p>One thing I've always tried to do is lint my PHP code as I go when working with WordPress so it won't bite me later if I try to submit the theme or plugin to the WordPress repositories.</p>
<p>The best, and as far as I know only, way to efficiently lint PHP code is with <a href="https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer">PHP Code Sniffer</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer">WordPress rules</a> to acompany it.</p>
<p>The process includes installing PHP Code sniffer, optionally creating a configuration file, and running the code, either from command line or from an existing build file.</p>
<h2 id="installation-methods">Installation Methods</h2>
<p>There are many ways to install PHP Code Sniffer. I will cover the two I consider the easiest ones.</p>
<h3 id="install-with-homebrew-on-macos">Install with Homebrew on macOS</h3>
<p>For macOS users the easiest way is to install PHP Code Sniffer via <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> with this command</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">brew <span class="token function">install</span> php-code-sniffer
</code></pre>
<h3 id="install-with-composer">Install with Composer</h3>
<p>The next easiest way is to install PHP Code Sniffer is to use [PHP Composer](phpcs --config-set tab_width 4) dependency manager</p>
<p>Follow the instructions in <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos">Installation - Linux / Unix / macOS</a> to install Composer.</p>
<p>Once it's set up, update it.</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">composer</span> self-update <span class="token operator">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="token punctuation">\</span>
<span class="token function">composer</span> global update
</code></pre>
<p>And do a global install of the required packages</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">composer</span> g require --dev wp-coding-standards/wpcs <span class="token punctuation">\</span>
dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer -W
</code></pre>
<h2 id="running-the-sniffer">Running the sniffer</h2>
<p>I normally run the sniffer from the command line.</p>
<p>I redirect the test results to a text file (<strong>--report-file=</strong>) so I can read it later, tell it that I want to use the WordPress standard set of sniffers (<strong>--standard=WordPress</strong>) and to lint all the PHP files in the current and all children directory (<strong>**/*.php</strong>).</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">phpcs --report-file<span class="token operator">=</span>PHPCS-report.txt <span class="token punctuation">\</span>
--standard<span class="token operator">=</span>WordPress **/*.php
</code></pre>
<p>We can also incorporate this command into the scripts portion of a <code>package.json</code> file</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js">scripts<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token string">"lint:php"</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">"phpcs --report-file=PHPCS-report.txt --standard=WordPress **/*.php"</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We can also use the same command to lint individual files; for example, if we're working on a file and want to lint to make sure we fixed problems in previous runs.</p>
<p>The following command line will lint functions.PHP and write the report to a text file.</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">phpcs --report-file<span class="token operator">=</span>PHPCS-report-functionsphp.txt --standard<span class="token operator">=</span>WordPress functions.php
</code></pre>
<h2 id="further-work">Further work</h2>
<p>Although the WordPress PHPCS settings are meant to exclude Javascript files so they can be linted with other tools, PHPCS will still lint them.</p>
<p>You could also customize the WordPress Coding standard ruleset to make it work for you.</p>
<p>Customization is not always a good idea because it may prevent your theme or plugin fromm being accepted in the WordPress <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">theme</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">plugin</a> directories, but if you're working on your own content or have additional sniffs to run then creating a custom rule that includes all the rules we want to lint against.</p>
