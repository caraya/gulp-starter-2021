<h1>Linting WordPress PHP code</h1>
<p>One thing I’ve always tried to do is lint my PHP code as I go when working with WordPress so it won’t bite me later if I try to submit the theme or plugin to the WordPress repositories.</p>
<p>The best, and as far as I know only, way to efficiently lint PHP code is with <a href="https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer">PHP Code Sniffer</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer">WordPress rules</a> to acompany it.</p>
<p>The process includes installing PHP Code sniffer, optionally creating a configuration file, and running the code, either from command line or from an existing build file.</p>
<h2>Installation Methods</h2>
<p>There are many ways to install PHP Code Sniffer. I will cover the two I consider the easiest ones.</p>
<h3>Install with Homebrew on macOS</h3>
<p>For macOS users the easiest way is to install PHP Code Sniffer via <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> with this command</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">brew install php-code-sniffer
</code></pre>
<h3>Install with Composer</h3>
<p>The next easiest way is to install PHP Code Sniffer is to use [PHP Composer](phpcs --config-set tab_width 4) dependency manager</p>
<p>Follow the instructions in <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos">Installation - Linux / Unix / macOS</a> to install Composer.</p>
<p>Once it’s set up, update it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">composer self-update &amp;&amp; \
composer global update
</code></pre>
<p>And do a global install of the required packages</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">composer g require --dev wp-coding-standards/wpcs \
dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer -W
</code></pre>
<h2>Running the sniffer</h2>
<p>I normally run the sniffer from the command line.</p>
<p>I redirect the test results to a text file (<strong>–report-file=</strong>) so I can read it later, tell it that I want to use the WordPress standard set of sniffers (<strong>–standard=WordPress</strong>) and to lint all the PHP files in the current and all children directory (<em><em>**/</em>.php</em>*).</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">phpcs --report-file=PHPCS-report.txt \
--standard=WordPress **/*.php
</code></pre>
<p>We can also incorporate this command into the scripts portion of a <code>package.json</code> file</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">scripts: {
  &quot;lint:php&quot;: &quot;phpcs --report-file=PHPCS-report.txt --standard=WordPress **/*.php&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can also use the same command to lint individual files; for example, if we’re working on a file and want to lint to make sure we fixed problems in previous runs.</p>
<p>The following command line will lint functions.PHP and write the report to a text file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">phpcs --report-file=PHPCS-report-functionsphp.txt --standard=WordPress functions.php
</code></pre>
<h2>Further work</h2>
<p>Although the WordPress PHPCS settings are meant to exclude Javascript files so they can be linted with other tools, PHPCS will still lint them.</p>
<p>You could also customize the WordPress Coding standard ruleset to make it work for you.</p>
<p>Customization is not always a good idea because it may prevent your theme or plugin fromm being accepted in the WordPress <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">theme</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">plugin</a> directories, but if you’re working on your own content or have additional sniffs to run then creating a custom rule that includes all the rules we want to lint against.</p>
