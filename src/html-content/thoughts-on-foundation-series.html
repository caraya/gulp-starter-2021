<h1>The foundation (tv) series so far (1 and 2)</h1>
<p>First two episodes of Foundation left me “meh”.</p>
<p>Too many changes that, while understandable, make it too much of a different story. It’s good science fiction but it’s not Foundation.</p>
<p>Salvor and Gaal (pronounced differently) are two of the characters I have issues with in the series. Yes, they need to give them background since Gaal is thrown head first into Trantor and the Foundation in the first chapter of Foundation, and Salvor is already established as a Terminus politician in the second and third parts of the book. Still the way they are portrayed are not necessarily the way they are presented in the book.</p>
<p>The conversation with Jerry, while different than the book, is eerily accurate, although it doesn’t present Trantor as the planet it is in the novels.</p>
<p>The series borrows liberally from all the books in the series in whatever order they want or need. The elevators were never discussed in the original trilogy (which is where I assume the material for this season is coming from)but in Prelude to Foundation and then in the Second Foundation trilogy.</p>
<p>I didn’t understand the 35 years ago card. Does it mean that the events in the series are from 35 years ago from Salvor’s perspective and are just telling the story to bring the viewers up to date?</p>
<p>I don’t know and that bugs me… Salvor Harding was never a contemporary of Hary Seldon and it’s confusing to me whether they are here or not.</p>
<p>I also understand the need to have something that will last through the entire series, even if each portion of each novel is different from the next with a different cast and different timeline. But what bugs me the most is how the genetic dynasty replaces both the emperor and the comission for public safety.</p>
<p>Is Hari traveling with the other characters to Terminus? I don’t know but that’s another big no-no. Hari doesn’t leave terminus and dies long before Salvor Harding becomes a key character.</p>
<p>They also take liberal license with the concepts from the first two parts of Foundation (the first novel). The leading ruling body of the foundation is not show until 50 years after they leave Terminus.</p>
<p>Robots are another interesting/troubling concept. Robots were not a part of the original trilogy, they only appear on Prelude to Foundation but in the series robots seem to be common knowledge (Hari mentions a robot war) and one of the genetic dynasty (brother dawn) seems to know pretty well that Demerzel is a robot.</p>
<p>Is Demerzel the same robot as the one in the book? Has (s)he lived 20000 years and been a contemporary of Elijah Baley? She seems a lot more inclined to violence than a robot who follows the three laws plus the zeroth law would be.</p>
<p>The vault in the series is completely different than the concept of the vault in the novels. In the series it was there when the Foundation pioneers arrived in Terminus and its content or purpose was a secret to all the people of the Foundation. In the novels the nature of the vault was unknown and its purpose was to allow Seldon to communitcate with his descendants during the crises.</p>
<p>What is the Prime Radiant doing on Terminus? In the novels we know that Hari kept the prime radiant in Trantor, where he stayed after the exile and it wasn’t until his death in Forward the Foundation that the prime radiant was shipped to Gaal Dornick in Terminus.</p>
<p>From my perspective the way they treat psychohistory is a bit of a mess. According to the novels Psychohistory can’t predict individual actions and events, only groups of people who are not aware of Pyschohistory and, for all intents and purposes, are acting blindly.</p>
<p>Who are the people that capture Salvor?</p>
