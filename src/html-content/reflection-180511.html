<p>I find this post and event particularly relevant in light of my own anniversary and the rethinking of the decisions that brought me to today</p>
<p>Unlike Louie, this has a more immediate and gut wrenching feeling to me. Will my kids (if any) or my partner know Chile like I did, more, less. Do I ever know the Chile of today versus the Chille I know and the Chile I remember.</p>
<p>I was an an adult when I moved to the US and mom was already here... but it was a learning experience, not always fun but certainly</p>
<p>&lt;pre&gt;Subo al techo a ver el huracán
Y me senté a esperar
Y sin pensaar
Saco fuerzaas de done no hay
Dejo mi mente en libertad
Vagabundear&lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>No, I don't regret the choice of leaving. I  do question the choice of not returning. Part of me is at peace with the 20+ extra  years I've spent in the US and part of me regrets the missed events and the missed friends.</p>
