<h2 id="performance-testing" tabindex="-1">Performance Testing</h2>
<p>Performance is one of the hotest topics and, in my experience, one of the hardest to get right. There are tools that will help developers measure and improve a site’s performance.</p>
<p>The idea behind Lighthouse is that by running it against your site, either staging or production periodically you can get a good overview of your site’s performance in the categories that lighthouse measures.</p>
<p>It will give you a baseline to measure against, find areas to improve on and track any regresswion that may have snuck by your testing.</p>
<h2 id="lighthouse" tabindex="-1">Lighthouse</h2>
<p>Lighthouse is an automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. It has audits for performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO, and progressive web apps.</p>
<p>You can run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools, as an extension, from the command line, or as a Node module. You give Lighthouse a URL to audit, it runs a series of audits against the page, and then it generates a report on how well the page did. Use the failing audits as indicators on how to improve the page… think of it as performance driven development.</p>
<h3 id="devtools-audit-menu" tabindex="-1">DevTools Audit Menu</h3>
<div class="message info">
  <p>To open DevTools hit <code>command+I</code> in Macintosh and <code>control+I</code> in Windows and Linux
</div>
<p>Lighthouse is now part of the Chrome DevTools suite of developer productivity tools. If you look at the audit menu you will see the lighthouse logo and the configuration for the tool.</p>

<p>If you haven’t already navigate to the page you want to test and click the audit menu in DevTools. For the purpose of these examples we’ll leave the default settings active; these may not all be necessary for all sites but give a good idea of how will your app or site work in a mid-level mobile device under less-than-optimal conditions.</p>
<h3 id="cli" tabindex="-1">CLI</h3>
<p>The source code for lighthouse is available on its <a href="https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse">Github Repository</a> and, from my perspective, it’s the best way to run Lighthouse without having a browser open and it gives you access to the latest and greatest</p>
<p>To get the CLI running you have to install <a href="https://yarnplg.com/">Yarn</a>. You can do so with your favorite package manager (Homebrew in Mac or Chocolatery in Windows) or following the instructions in Yarn’s <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#alternatives-stable">Installation</a> page.</p>
<p>Once Yarn is installed, download the Lighthouse code from Github. Easiest way is to use the Git command line tool:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">git</span> pull --recursive https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse.git
</code></pre>
<p>Once it has downloaded all the dependencies we can build the tools by running <code>yarn build-all</code> in the terminal.</p>
<p>Lighthouse run a series of tasks in its own istance of Chrome. The results are provided in an HTML page that you can open in your default browser automatically.</p>
<p>The example below will use the Lighthouse CLI we just built to test a site and display the result document in the user’s default browser.</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">node</span> lighthouse-cli/ https://web-layout-experiments.firebaseapp.com --view
</code></pre>
<h2 id="npm-module" tabindex="-1">NPM Module</h2>
<p>If you need to build lighthouse into your build or CI processes or don’t want to be bothered with another package manager, there is an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lighthouse">NPM Plugin</a> to handle your needs.</p>
<p>Install it like any other plugins. I prefer global installation in this case:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">npm</span> i -g lighthouse
</code></pre>
<p>Then run it against an example site. Using the site from the CLI example:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">lighthouse-cli/ https://web-layout-experiments.firebaseapp.com
</code></pre>
