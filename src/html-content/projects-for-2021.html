<h1 id="projects-for-2021">Projects for 2021</h1>
<p>I want to target three languages and tools for learning in 2021: Vue, Go and Electron.</p>
<p>These projects are the ones I’ve thought about so far. I may have additional ones come up as the year progresses.</p>
<p>This will also enable to create a monorepo for each of these projects that needs one and use Bazel as the build system.</p>
<h2 id="wordpress-in-vue">WordPress in Vue</h2>
<p>I’ve always liked Vue better than React (regardless of the later’s popularity and usage) so I started working on a combination of Vue and the WordPress REST API.</p>
<p>See the following blog entries for the work I’ve already done:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/wordpress-vue-building-a-blog/">WordPress + Vue: Building a blog</a></li>
<li><a href="https://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/adding-jwt-to-wordpress/">Adding JWT to WordPress</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some things to do moving forward</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical
<ul>
<li>Upgrade to Nuxt 3.x whenever they update the code to use Vue 3.x</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Components and Features
<ul>
<li>Create a pagination component</li>
<li>Create a page component</li>
<li>Create a framework to handle custom content types</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Editor
<ul>
<li>Is it possible to create an editor to publish content as a set of Vue components</li>
<li>Is it worth the effort</li>
<li>Does it makes more sense to use the WordPress backend for publishing content?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ebook-manifest-generator-(go)">Ebook Manifest generator (Go)</h2>
<p>One of the earlier projects I did in Python (and the reason why I deeply dislike Stack Overflow) was an epub ebook generator.</p>
<p>What would it take to make the same tool in Go? The steps are as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read in a JSON file with the required document metadata</li>
<li>Read a recursive list of files in the directory</li>
<li>Match each file to its mime type, either with a map or a built-in library</li>
<li>Write the file pulling from the JSON file and the list of file and mime types</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is that the resulting file should pass validation.</p>
<p>We can also compile this to WASM to run in the browser or in an Electron applicaation.</p>
<h2 id="content-editor-(electron%3F)">Content Editor (Electron?)</h2>
<p>I think web technologies are at the point where we can create applications that do most of what we want.</p>
<p>Starting with a basic Electron application the idea is to follow these steps in roughly this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Work with <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a> from the start</li>
<li>User the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor">Monaco</a> text editor as the core editor for the following formats
<ul>
<li>Markdown</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>SCSS</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>XML</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Handle file management tasks with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API">File System Access API</a></li>
<li>Export Markdown to HTML</li>
<li>Allow packaging of content into zipped bundles, <a href="http://idpf.org/epub/30/">epub3</a>, and <a href="https://web.dev/web-bundles/">web bundles</a></li>
<li>Research what it would take to convert the web bundler tool and the ebook manifest generator into <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WASM</a> so it can be used directly in the app</li>
</ol>
<p>This is just the basics. It needs more thorough analysis and a more rigurous design document.</p>
<h2 id="xapi-profile-and-library-(typescript)">xAPI Profile and Library (Typescript)</h2>
<p>I wrote a series of posts about <a href="https://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/building-an-xapi-profile/">building an xAPI profile</a>.</p>
<p>The project seeks to understand what would it take to build these xAPI statement to send to an LRS? as new tools and articles from <a href="https://xapi.com/">Rustici Software</a> in the coming year. The specific stems may include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setup an LRS for development or work with SCORM cloud as the development system</li>
<li>Build a profile for developers
<ul>
<li>Take into account the most common features that we expect them to do</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Build statements to send to the LRS
<ul>
<li>Group these statements into a reusable library</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implement the library on a sample static site</li>
<li>Implement the library as a WordPress plugin or directly on a theme</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="vue.js-tutorial-for-the-absolute-beginner">Vue.js Tutorial for the absolute beginner</h2>
<p>Frameworks in general and the big three frameworks (Angular, React and Vue) in particular are hard to break into and assume knowledge that may or may not be there.</p>
<p>The idea is to write a project-based series of articles on how to work with Vue, assuming no prior knowledge and some basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
<p>The only thing that this needs is a project to work for these posts. This is different than the blog project.</p>
