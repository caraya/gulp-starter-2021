<h1>Fixing width of items in Gutenberg full site editor</h1>
<p>One of the things I’ve struggled with when building my block theme using the full site editor is the width of items in the header and footer.</p>
<p>The header kinda works but the footer doesn’t and it’s limited to the width of the content.</p>
<p>I attended the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/wordpress-social-learning/events/284383346">Builder Basics</a> where they discussed Block Layout, Alignment, Dimensions, and Spacing</p>
<p>From the talk I learned that I was doing things wrong.</p>
