<p>Questions about lazy loading and why it’s enabled by default?</p>
<p>I’ve been reading the relevant discussions: <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44427">TRAC 44427</a>, and issues #18, and #4 in this repository but I still have questions about the rationale for making lazy loading the default without providing a way to change the behavior when needed.</p>
<p>I can see three cases where images should not automatically lazy load or the option should be given to the theme developer to choose whether lazy loading is acceptable or not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog Header images</li>
<li>Single pages post featured images</li>
<li>Content above the fold</li>
</ul>
