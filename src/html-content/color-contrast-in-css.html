<h1>Color Contrast in CSS</h1>
<p>The CSS Color Level 5 specification defines a way to provide contrast between background and foreground colors.</p>
<p>The <code>color-contrast()</code> function takes the followng arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>A color for the background</li>
<li>Two or more colors to compare against the background color. The one with the highest constrast ratio will be used as the foreground color with an optional <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum">target constrast level</a> will be used.
<ul>
<li>The target contrast level can be a number or the strings: AA, AA-large, AAA or AAA-large each representing a a different requirement for body text versus large text (they have different contrast requirements) and AA versus AAA WCAG 2.1 compliance levels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The example below shows how to use the <code>color-contrast()</code> function to provide a contrast ratio of at least 3.0 for the text color.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">  color: color-contrast(#f8efec vs 
    #1438bd, #1e456e, #f3ebad 
    to AA-large);
</code></pre>
<p>What the example is saying is: For a background color of #f8efec, find the color with the highest contrast ratio among the three colors I gave you (#1438bd, #1e456e, #f3ebad) that matches the crteria for AA-large WCAG 2.1 compliance.</p>
<p>We can also flip the requirement around and use color contrast to provide a background color that meets the requirements.</p>
<p>This function presents an interesting way to do contrast ratio calculations in CSS and provide color alternatives for the user</p>
