<h1 id="noto-fonts%3A-same-family%2C-multiple-languages" tabindex="-1">Noto Fonts: Same family, multiple languages</h1>
<p>One of the limitations of the World Wide Web is the lack of fonts for all the world languages. Even if we were to find fonts for all the languages we want to use it‚Äôs unlikely that we‚Äôll find fonts that work well together.</p>
<p>Google has developed and released as open source a family of fonts that cover all the languages covered in the <a href="https://unicode.org/">Unicode standard</a>. They are not quite up to the inteded goal of full Unicoode support but they are getting close.</p>
<p>The idea is to have a set of fonts for Unicode languages that work well together and look good together.</p>
<p>This is a different problem than the one Variable fonts solve; variable fonts interpolate font attributes such as weight, slant, and custom attributes between axes meaning that we need fewer font files to represent the same group of characters. However, this doesn‚Äôt include all the characters that we need for non western European languages; for that we still need multiple files.</p>
<h2 id="quick-note-about-licenses" tabindex="-1">Quick note about licenses</h2>
<p>As we start diving into the Noto family we need to look at the license for the fonts. For a while Google used to license fonts under the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0">Apache 2 license</a>, just like their other software but as of 2015 they moved the license to the <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=OFL">SIL Open Font License 1.1</a></p>
<h2 id="using-the-fonts" tabindex="-1">Using the fonts</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm working with web content so I‚Äôll concentrate in that aspect of font usage and not worry about local use or bundling them with an app.</p>
<p>Make sure that the fonts are available as web fonts when you declare them. When you declare the font in your CSS but don‚Äôt load them as web fonts, the browser will immediately go to the next option in the stack.</p>
<p>Compress the fonts using either WOFF or WOFF2 depending on your browser support needs. The same suggestions outlined in <a href="https://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/improving-font-performance-work-to-control-font-loading">Improving Font Performance: Work to control font loading</a> and <a href="https://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/improving-font-performance-subset-fonts-using-glyphhanger/">Improving Font Performance: Subset fonts using Glyphhanger</a> apply when working with multiple fonts of the same family.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend using <a href="https://css-tricks.com/font-display-masses/">font-display</a> to improve performance and keep yourself from Flash of Invisible and Flash of Unstyled Text.</p>
<p>Serve your fonts from the same domain as your app. Some Noto fonts are available at <a href="https://fonts.google.com/earlyaccess">Google Web Fonts Early Access</a> but they may not be the latest version of Noto or it may only cover a subset of the language.</p>
<p>In addition, be aware that the web latency for large fonts, such as for Noto Sans CJK or when using multiple languages, can be large. Google Fonts uses <code>font-display: swap</code> to mitigate the problem but the solution may still not be ideal in all cases, particularly when working with slow devices or in areas with pooor connectivity.</p>

<h3 id="using-noto-fonts-in-the-css-font-family-property" tabindex="-1">Using Noto fonts in the CSS font-family property</h3>
<p>Because fonts in the Noto family may overlap there are some considerations as written by the Google Fonts team</p>
<p>Put fonts for the languages/scripts you care about most at the very beginning.</p>
<p>This should go without saying but don‚Äôt include fonts you don‚Äôt need to improve Time to First Byte (TTFB), Time To Interactive (TTI), and other performance metrics.</p>
<p>It is recommended to retain ‚ÄúNoto Sans‚Äù in the list. Other Noto fonts usually do not cover Latin letters, digits or punctuation.  If you‚Äôre writing content that doesn‚Äôt require any Latin language you can forego Noto Sans on your list.</p>
<p>Put ‚ÄúNoto Sans‚Äù before ‚ÄúNoto Sans CJK‚Äù. Currently, the Latin characters in the CJK fonts are from <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/source-sans">Adobe‚Äôs Source Sans Pro</a> so they may not look the same as the other sans serif fonts in the document.</p>
<p>Wherever possible use ‚ÄúNoto Sans CJK {JP, KR, SC, TC}‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúNoto Sans {JP, KR, SC, TC}‚Äù (note the difference in the file names).</p>
<p>Each of the font families ‚ÄúNoto Sans CJK {JP, KR, SC, TC}‚Äù supports all four languages, but has a different default language. So depending on the primary language you‚Äôre targetting what font you should use.</p>
<h3 id="examples" tabindex="-1">Examples</h3>
<p>These examples assume that you‚Äôve already loaded using <code>@font-face</code> or, if you‚Äôre happy with the restrictions that Google Fonts may add to the fonts it delivers, through Google Fonts.  It also assumes that the names on the @font-face declarations match the names we use in the <code>font-family</code> rules.</p>
<p>For a Japanese website:</p>
<pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css"><span class="token property">font-family</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>  <span class="token string">"Noto Sans"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
              <span class="token string">"Noto Sans CJK JP"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
              sans-serif<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>For a website targeting Hindi, and then Tamil users</p>
<pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css"><span class="token property">font-family</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>  <span class="token string">"Noto Sans Devanagari"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
              <span class="token string">"Noto Sans Tamil"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
              <span class="token string">"Noto Sans"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
              sans-serif<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>For an Arabic website that needs to use an UI font for UI elements, such as buttons and tabs, that have more strict vertical space:</p>
<pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css"><span class="token property">font-family</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>  <span class="token string">"Noto Naskh Arabic UI"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
              <span class="token string">"Noto Sans UI"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
              sans-serif<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>For a website targeting Armenian and Georgian users who prefer serif style:</p>
<pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css"><span class="token property">font-family</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>  <span class="token string">"Noto Serif Armenian"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
              <span class="token string">"Noto Serif Georgian"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
              <span class="token string">"Noto Serif"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
              serif<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="why-bother%3F" tabindex="-1">Why bother?</h2>
<p>I like to think that fonts like Noto and other fonts that target specific non Latin (especially ethnic, endangered or minority) languages give people who wouldn‚Äôt normally have one a voice on the web. It allows them to communicate in their own language and helps make true the promise of a world wide web.</p>
