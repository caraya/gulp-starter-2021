<h1>I give up, Preact it is</h1>
<p>I’m still not a fan of frameworks but I have to accept that, because they are the latest buzzwords and everyone is using them, I need to at least be aware of what they are and what they can do. I’ve decided to take a look at Preact, explore how it works and research some of the issues I have with frameworks in general, namely accessibility, controlling payload sizes and what happens when JS is not available.</p>
<h2>How it works?</h2>
<p>For this example we’ll use <a href="https://github.com/developit/preact-cli">Preact CLI</a> to build our application</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># once and you're good:
npm i -g preact-cli

# create a new project:
preact create my-great-app
cd my-great-app

# start a live-reload/HMR dev server:
npm start
</code></pre>
<h2>Accessibility in Responsive Frameworks</h2>
<h2>Controlling payload sizes</h2>
<h3>React and Webpack</h3>
<h2>Do we have a fallback?</h2>
