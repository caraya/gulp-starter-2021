<h1>Checking web compatibility</h1>
<p>When working with web content, it is important to check what browsers your content is compatible with.</p>
<p>There are three ways to do this:</p>
<p><a href="https://caniuse.com">caniuse</a> provides a basic compatibility table for most major desktop and mobile browsers.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN</a> goes a step further than Caniuse, it also provides additional information about the property, how it works and the specification that the property belongs to.</p>
<p>Both Caniuse and MDN require you to have a browser open on the right site and actively search for the property or API youâ€™re looking for.</p>
<p>MDN also provides its <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdn/browser-compat-data">browser compatibility data</a> as an NPM package that you can use as the database for your own project or as a standalone library to query MDN browser compatibility data.</p>
