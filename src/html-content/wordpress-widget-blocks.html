<h1 id="wordpress-widget-blocks">WordPress Widget Blocks</h1>
<p>If you use WordPress as your CMS and choose to keep the existing theme structure, then the news is relevant to you. Otherwise, you can skip this post.</p>
<p>Among other new, WordPress 5.8 introduces a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/29/block-based-widgets-editor-in-wordpress-5-8/">Block-Based Widget Editor</a>, built using the same Gutenberg editor that you use to create posts.</p>
<p>You can now use any block in your theme’s widget areas using the all new Widgets screen and updated Customizer.</p>
<p>For this post, I will concentrated on creating and adding widgets using the widget menu (<strong>appearance -&gt; widgets</strong>) rather than the customizer.</p>

<p>The Widget Menu will now show a list of all the widget areas available to the theme and offer you the option to add blocks to each of those areas.</p>

<p>In order to replicate the existing widget structure for my theme, I will work with Footer Widget Area 1 and Footer Widget Area 2.</p>
<p>When you first load the menu, the area will be blank and you’ll get a button to add blocks.</p>

<p>When you click the button to add a widget WordPress will present you a list of available blocks to add and a search box if you already know what block you want. In this case I searched for <code>search</code> and then clicked the block.</p>

<p>Each block has its own configuration. In the case of the search block, we get the option of having a search button next to the search input, whether to have a label to indicate what the input does, and the choice to have placeholder text inside the search input.</p>

<p>We need to configure each block individually and the configuration will depend on each widget block.</p>
<p>By configuring each block I was able to recreate the layout of the widgets in my blog’s footer :)</p>

<p>This is a big change, just like Gutenberg but there are good news and news that might be good.</p>
<p>Existing third party widgets continue to work via the Legacy Widget block so, in a worst case scenario, it will continue to work as before.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to use widget blocks, you have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/">Classic Widgets</a> plugin</li>
<li>Call <code>remove_theme_support( ‘widgets-block-editor’ )</code> from within your theme</li>
</ul>
<p>Now for the ‘you’ll have to decide if they are good’ news.</p>
<p>The classic widget plugin is an all-or-nothing solution. If you want to ease into block-based widgets you’ll have to keep the block widget editor and leverage the Legacy Widget block.</p>
<p>Support for the plugin is not indefinite. Just like the Classic Editor plugin, support from the WordPress team will continue as long as there’s demand for it.</p>
