<p><strong>exoskeletons and external enhancement</strong></p>
<p>It is already possible to build exoskeletons to support physical activity. See the work by <a href="(https://www.media.mit.edu/people/hherr/projects/)">Hugh Herr</a> and the <a href="http://biomech.media.mit.edu/#/">Mechatronics Group</a> at the MIT Media Lab.</p>

<p><strong>neural manipulation and mmi (man/machine interface)</strong></p>
<p>Another area of Herr’s research is how to integrate prosthetics and bionic limbs with the user’s actual body. The bionic limb will read the electrical impulses from the actual body and use those impulses to make the limb work like a natural part of the user’s body.</p>
<p>From the earliest research in the field (<a href="http://biomech.media.mit.edu/#/portfolio_page/neural-interface-technology-for-advanced-prosthetic-limbs/">http://biomech.media.mit.edu/#/portfolio_page/neural-interface-technology-for-advanced-prosthetic-limbs/</a>)</p>
<p>The work was later enhanced to provide full control of prosthetics and bionics for people who chose elective amputations and for a wider variety of movements and activities.</p>
<p><strong>neural interfaces (think cyberpunk)</strong></p>
<p>This is compounded by the fact that we’re not only becoming more like our machines, our machines are becoming more like us.</p>
<p>In the late 2010s and early 2020’s the VR technology improved with the inclusion of dermal patches that led to improved neural interfaces between the helmets and the instruments they control.</p>
<p><strong>Vehicle swarms</strong></p>
<p><strong>AI Real Time Piloting and Autonomous Drones</strong></p>
<p>It’s against this background that we’re telling stories. How do these technologies affect people, their profession and their interactions.</p>
<p>Part of the story is to tell how we got to the present where the stories are told, far into the future to make the technology plausible but not too far to remove ourselves too much from the stories.</p>
<p>The other part of the story centers on a group of cyborg special operatives who use technologies like these in their work and who they are.</p>
