<p>&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-theme=&quot;dark&quot; data-link-color=&quot;#2B7BB9&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This is going to sound like a silly question, but bear with me... ;) Why do people decide to use frameworks? I know my answers, I'd love to know yours.&lt;/p&gt;â€” Nicole Sullivan (@stubbornella) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stubbornella/status/1050119577823113216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 10, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/">you might not need jQuery</a> page that lists how to do things that were exclusive to jQuery using DOM APIs that are supported as far back as IE8. They are good starting points but far from being the perfect solution to development problems.</p>
<p>Likewise, as developers we've equated frameworks with performance and developer experience with user happiness.</p>
<p>I'm not against frameworks. They have their place and they are very useful when working on large-scale applications. But they are not the solution to all problems facing web developers.</p>
