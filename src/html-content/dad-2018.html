<p>Can’t believe it’s already been 15 years… I still have that day etched in my memory and I’m starting to be ok with it… I’m starting to understand what happened. I can’t accept that your demons took you away from me (even though we were never really close or together) and I was too proud to reach out when (unknown to me) it really mattered. I don’t think that’ll ever go away and I’m staarting to fully comme to term with it.</p>
<p>Look what I found… pictures of you in highschool…  in California.</p>
