<p><a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> provides an interesting take on using frameworks to create web content. It provides all the functionality of frameworks but the result is a static site that can be deployed to any web server.</p>
<p>What I like the most about Astro is that it will components from any framework (Preact, React, Svelte and Vue are the ones I'm familir with) along with an <code>.astro</code> format that is eclusive to the Astro build system and that we will discuss later in the post.</p>
<p>To create a new Astro application follow these steps:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">npm</span> init astro
<span class="token function">npm</span> <span class="token function">install</span>
<span class="token function">npm</span> start
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a new Astro application, install dependencies and start the development server.</p>

<p>Once the application is running we can make changes and they will be reflected on the page automatically.</p>
