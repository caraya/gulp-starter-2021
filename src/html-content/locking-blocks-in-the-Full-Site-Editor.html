<h1 id="locking-blocks-in-the-full-site-editor-1" tabindex="-1">Locking blocks in the full site editor</h1>
<p>One of the things that I find missing from WordPress is to give theme developers the ability to control what we can and cannot do in the full site editor.</p>
<p>In 6.0, we get a first set of locking features. We can lock individual block and prevent them from being moved or being deleted.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-to-lock-blocks%3F" tabindex="-1">Why do we need to lock blocks?</h2>
<p>There are a few cases where locking blocks is useful.</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to keep pieces of content together (movement)</li>
<li>We need a disclaimer or copyright notice to always be available where we placed it (removal)</li>
<li>We would like to prevent authors from moving the content of a group individually but only move the group as a unit (both)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preparing-the-content" tabindex="-1">Preparing the content</h2>
<p>To start we need to create a few blocks in the template editor in order to have material to work with.</p>
<p>Go into the site editor by clicking the editor (beta) link under the appearance menu</p>
<figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651791672/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking1/block-locking1.png?_i=AA" alt="Location of the full site editor in the Appearance menu" /></figure>
<p>Under the blog header, create a group block. You can click on the block inserter and then search for <code>group</code> and then click on the <code>group</code> block to insert it into the current template.</p>
<figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651793971/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking2/block-locking2.png?_i=AA" alt="Block inserter searching for a block and preview of group block" /></figure>
<p>Add two paragraph blocks inside the group block. These are the blocks that we’ll be working with in the rest of the lesson.</p>
<h2 id="locking-movement" tabindex="-1">Locking movement</h2>
<p>AS we discussed earlier there might be times when we want to prevent authors from moving blocks individually.</p>
<p>As an example we’ll be locking the first paragraph inside the group block we created earlier.</p>
<p>In the full site editor, select the first paragraph block inside the group block and select the options menu on the far right side.</p>
<figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651850251/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking3/block-locking3.png?_i=AA" alt="Options menu for paragraph block showing the Lock option, fifth options from the bottom, highlighted in blue text" /></figure>
<p>You will then be presented with a modal dialogue to select your lock option or options:</p>
<figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651878505/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking4/block-locking4.png?_i=AA" alt="Block locking modal dialogue for paragraph block with no options selected" /></figure>
<p>Click the checkbox next to <code>Disable movement</code> and click apply.</p>
<p>No one without the required permissions will be able to move the block.</p>
<h2 id="locking-removal" tabindex="-1">Locking removal</h2>
<p>The other type of locking that is available is preventing removal blocks. This is useful when you want to keep a block in the template but you don’t want it to be removed.</p>
<p>In the full site editor, select the second paragraph block inside the group block and select the options menu on the far right side.</p>
<p>When you click the options menu and select the lock menu item, you will presented with the lock dialogue for the paragraph block.</p>
<p>In this case select the checkbox next to the <code>Prevent removal</code> option and then click <code>Apply</code>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651853891/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking5/block-locking5.png?_i=AA'" alt="Block locking modal dialogue for paragraph block with no options selected" /></figure>
<p>This indicates that we would want other theme developers not to remove the block.</p>
<h2 id="locking-both" tabindex="-1">Locking both</h2>
<p>The final locking strategy is to restrict both moving and removal of the target blocks.</p>
<p>There are two ways to lock both options.</p>
<p>The first one is to select the checkboxes next to both options and click <code>Apply</code>.</p>
<p>The second option is to click the <code>Lock all</code> option and then click <code>Apply</code>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651878500/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking6/block-locking6.png?_i=AA" alt="Block locking modal dialogue for paragraph block with no options selected" /></figure>
<h2 id="test-the-locked-blocks" tabindex="-1">Test the locked blocks</h2>
<p>We’ve covered how to lock block to preveent removal, movement and both of them together.</p>
<p>Now we need to test if the locks we put on the blocks are working.</p>
<h3 id="testing-movement-lock" tabindex="-1">Testing movement lock</h3>
<p>Go to the theme editor and click on the first paragraph inside the group block we created.</p>
<p>The quickest way to check if we can move a block is to check whether the <code>lock</code> icon is visible. If it is visible then the block is locked. We can check what lock was applied by clicking on the lock; this will display the lock dialogue.</p>
<figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651963975/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking8_80380433f9e/block-locking8_80380433f9e.png?_i=AA" alt="The blue lock icon shows that there is a lock applied to the block" /></figure>
<p>When a block is not locked you will see the drag handle and the arrows to move the block up and down</p>
<figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651963977/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking10_803806f45e5/block-locking10_803806f45e5.png?_i=AA" alt="Unloocked blocks show the drag handle and movement arrows" /></figure>
<h3 id="testing-removal-lock" tabindex="-1">Testing Removal lock</h3>
<p>Testing the <code>prevent removal</code> lock is a little more complicated. There is no visible change in the block configuration strip. The way to test if we’ve successfully locked the block is to check if the remove block (<code>remove paragraph</code> for our example) is available in the options menu</p>
<figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651963978/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking7/block-locking7.png?_i=AA" alt="Preventing block removal eliminates the Remove block item at the bottom of the options menu" /></figure>
<p>We need to be extremely careful when we check the lock status of the blocks. We can check if the locks we set are enabled but, at the same time, can disable any locks set up for a given block</p>
<h3 id="lesson-wrap-up" tabindex="-1">Lesson Wrap Up</h3>
<p>And this is the wrap-up of the lesson. We’ve looked at the different ways to lock blocks and how to tese if the locks are working.</p>
<p>Follow with the Exercises and Assessment outlined above.</p>
