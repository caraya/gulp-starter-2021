<h1 id="what-is-really-a-pwa%3F">What is really a PWA?</h1>
<p>Two recent posts made me revisit PWAs, what they are and how we should proceed moving forward. Since Alex Russell and Francisc Berriman coined the term (in <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/">Progressive Web Apps: Escaping Tabs Without Losing Our Soul</a>) I’ve seen a lot written about PWAs (including the course I collaborated in while at Google) and a lot of confusion as to what makes a Progressive Web Application.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Frances and Alex defined these as the characteristics of a PWA:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">Responsive</a></strong>: to fit any form factor</li>
<li><strong>Connectivity independent</strong>: Progressively-enhanced with <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/">Service Workers</a> to let them work offline</li>
<li><strong>App-like-interactions</strong>: Adopt a Shell + Content application model to create appy navigations &amp; interactions</li>
<li><strong>Fresh</strong>: Transparently always up-to-date thanks to the Service Worker update process</li>
<li><strong>Safe</strong>: Served via TLS (a Service Worker requirement) to prevent snooping</li>
<li><strong>Discoverable</strong>: Are identifiable as “applications” thanks to <a href="https://w3c.github.io/manifest/">W3C</a> <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/11/Support-for-installable-web-apps-with-webapp-manifest-in-chrome-38-for-Android">Manifests</a> and Service Worker registration scope allowing search engines to find them</li>
<li><strong>Re-engageable</strong>: Can access the re-engagement UIs of the OS; e.g. <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/push-notificatons-on-the-open-web">Push Notifications</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/increasing-engagement-with-app-install-banners-in-chrome-for-android?hl=en%22%3E"><strong>Installable to the home screen through browser-provided prompts</strong></a>, allowing users to “keep” apps they find most useful without the hassle of an app store</li>
<li><strong>Linkable</strong>: meaning they’re zero-friction, zero-install, and easy to share. The social <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/dark-social-we-have-the-whole-history-of-the-web-wrong/263523/">power of URLs</a> <em>matters</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So we know what to build and have the technologies to do so. So why don’t we.</p>
<p>As Paul points in his post it is not easy to do from a technical standpoint and it’s not easy to convince developers, particularly those working in content-only sites that PWAs are good for them.</p>
