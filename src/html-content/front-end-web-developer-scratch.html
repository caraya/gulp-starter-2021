<p><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/05/frontend-developers-designers/">How Frontend Developers Can Help To Bridge The Gap Between Designers And Developers</a> provides what I think is a good starting point. The article argues for better communication and building bridges between the design and developer communities.</p>
<p>And who better than the front end developer who has to translate the design into code and then work with the backend developers to make sure that the resulting code matches the design?</p>
<p>Chris uses a sad but true analogy to open his post. I’ll use it to close mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two front-end developers are sitting at a bar. They have nothing to talk about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the worst part is… they should.</p>
