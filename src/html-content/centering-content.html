<h1>Center vertically and horizontally</h1>
<p>I was working on typesetting poems when I thought what it would take to center a piece of content both vertically and horizontally?</p>
<p>For image and smaller blocks of text like poems, I choose to work with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/">flexbox</a> as it provides, in my opinion, the simplest way to center content on both axes without scripting.</p>
<p>The code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.container {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Some caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must set an explicit height for the container, in this case 100vh. Otherwise there is no height to center to</li>
<li>Because weâ€™re centering all the content it may be a good idea to create an inner container, otherwise paragraphs and other individual elements may be centered and cause unexpected results.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see working examples of this in my <a href="https://web-layout-experiments.firebaseapp.com/demo26.html">poema 6</a> and <a href="https://web-layout-experiments.firebaseapp.com/demo27.html">poema 19</a> demos. An <a href="https://codepen.io/caraya/pen/mzQjzV">editable example of poema 6</a> is in Codepen.</p>
