<h1 id="complexity">Complexity</h1>
<p>This tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov">Dan Abramov</a> made me think about complexity, how do we define it, why have our apps become so complicated to build and whether all that complexity is necessary.</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;JS show idea: developer is given requirements for a modern interactive webapp but they’re only allowed to use tools from five years ago (before front-end became complicated).&lt;/p&gt;— Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1004403873937854465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>Later on in the thread Dan (creator of React) states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My point is that much of the tech I’m seeing popular today (eg webpack) helps solve problems that I found very challenging 5 years ago (eg code splitting). YMMV</p>
<p>And that was sort of in response to the sentiment that tools just replace each other like fads for no good reason because developers like complexity. (It’s sometimes said as a joke but some people genuinely feel that way)</p>

<p>This has been in my min</p>
