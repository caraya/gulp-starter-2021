<h1>The New Knowledge Navigator</h1>
<p>In the early to mid 1980’s Apple released the video below as a demo for future connected devices. The “knowledge navigator” was a device that could be used to navigate the world’s knowledge and interact with all your devices.</p>

<p>I thought it was cute but until newer technologies like digital assistants (alexa, google assistant, etc) came along, it wasn’t really feasible to create such a tool.</p>
<p>While it may still not be possible to create an agent as effective as the navigator, we may be able to duplicate some of its functionality.</p>
<p>Some of the areas that I want to take a deeper look at are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assistants like <a href="https://www.apple.com/siri/">Siri</a>, <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-skills-kit">Alexa</a>, or <a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant">Google Assistant</a> to see if it’s possible to use them as the base for the project</li>
<li>Speech synthesis using technologies like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf">WaveNet</a>, if it is possible to do so</li>
</ul>
<h2>Digital assistants</h2>
<p>Digital assistants work with the user to provide a conversational interface to fulfill the user’s needs.</p>
<p>There are others but I will concentrate on Google Assistant, the one I’m most familiar with and the one I’m most excited about. We’ll look at three areas:</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant">Integrate with Google Assistant</a> discusses how to integrate different types of content with Google Assistant.</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/app/overview">App Actions overview</a> describes how to enhance your Android applications with Assistant’s features.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most intriguing part is <a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/content/">Enhance your web presence for Search and Assistant</a> where you can create a custom web experience for Google Assistant based on your web content marked up with <a href="https://developers.google.com/structured-data/">structured data</a>.</p>
<h2>Designing actions for Google Assistant</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversation-design/welcome">Designing Actions on Google</a> provides more details on how to create conversations and dialogue flows for the assistant.</p>
