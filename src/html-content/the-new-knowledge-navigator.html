<h1>The New Knowledge Navigator</h1>
<p>In the early to mid 1980’s Apple released the video below as a demo for future connected devices. The “knowledge navigator” was a device that could be used to navigate the world’s knowledge and interact with all your devices.</p>

<p>I thought it was cute but until newer technologies like digital assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant, etc) came along, it wasn’t really feasible to create such a tool.</p>
<p>While it may still not be possible to create an agent as effective as the navigator show in the video, we may be able to duplicate some of its functionality.</p>
<p>Some of the areas that I want to take a deeper look at are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assistants like <a href="https://www.apple.com/siri/">Siri</a>, <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-skills-kit">Alexa</a>, or <a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant">Google Assistant</a> to see if it’s possible to use them as the base for the project</li>
<li>Speech synthesis using technologies like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf">WaveNet</a>, if it is possible to do so or speech to text technologies</li>
<li>Creating a backend for the assistant to work from</li>
</ul>
<h2>Working with a digital assistant</h2>
<p>Unless you’re working on an Android application, you will have to build actions for the assistant to perform, rather than have to build a dedicated application, although an application may be the best solution in the long run.</p>
<p>An example of how to build actions for Google Assistant is shown in <a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/quickstart">Actions SDK and Builder quick start guide</a>.</p>
