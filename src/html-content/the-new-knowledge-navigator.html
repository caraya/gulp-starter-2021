<h1>The New Knowledge Navigator</h1>
<p>In the early to mid 1980’s Apple released the video below as a demo for future connected devices. The “knowledge navigator” was a device that could be used to navigate the world’s knowledge and interact with all your devices.</p>

<p>I thought it was cute but until newer technologies like digital assistants (alexa, google assistant, etc) came along, it wasn’t really feasible to create such a tool.</p>
<p>While it may still not be possible to create an agent as effective as the navigator, we may be able to duplicate some of its functionality.</p>
<p>Some of the areas that I want to take a deeper look at are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant to see if it’s possible to use them as the base for the project</li>
<li>Speech synthesis using technologies like <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf">WaveNet</a>, if it is possible to do so</li>
</ul>
