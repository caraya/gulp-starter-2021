<h1>Creating and Running Your Own Homebrew Tap</h1>
<p>I love Homebrew, I really do. But some of the limitations of the system, while understandable from a maintenance point of view, can be really frutrating.</p>
<p>The latest example, and what prompted me to look at this is Graphics Magick and it’s Perl package dependency.</p>
<p>I get it I’m probably in the minority wanting to run Graphics Magick Perl module. The downside is that the only way to get it is to install it as a dependency when you compile the Graphics Magick package.</p>
<p>That would be great, except that Homebrew formula doesn’t support the Perl module dependency. There is no way to add the <code>--with-perl</code> option to the formula at install time and there is no external way to install the Perl module.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap">How to Create and Maintain a Tap</a> the Homebrew team shows how to create a tap and how to add formulae and casks to it.</p>
