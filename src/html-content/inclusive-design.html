<p>One thing that I've heard spoken together with progressive enhancement and accessibility is inclusive design.</p>
<p>At first, this article was part of my post on progressive enhancement but then I thought that it was better to split them out and dig a little deeper into inclusive design and how it relates to accessibility and progressive enhancement (if they are related at all).</p>
<h2 id="defining-the-term">Defining the term</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The British Standards Institute (2005) defines inclusive design as: ‘The design of mainstream products and/or services that are accessible to, and usable by, as many people as reasonably possible… without the need for special adaptation or specialised design.’</p>
<p>Inclusive design does not suggest that it is always possible (or appropriate) to design one product to address the needs of the entire population. Instead, inclusive design guides an appropriate design response to diversity in the population through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing a family of products and derivatives to provide the best possible coverage of the population.</li>
<li>Ensuring that each individual product has clear and distinct target users.</li>
<li>Reducing the level of ability required to use each product, in order to improve the user experience for a broad range of customers, in a variety of situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>— <a href="http://www.inclusivedesigntoolkit.com/whatis/whatis.html">Definition of inclusive design</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What intrigued me about this definition is the first bulet point: <em><strong>Developing a family of products and derivatives to provide the best possible coverage of the population.</strong></em></p>
<p>The definition sounds a lot like progressive enhancement, but it's not quite the same.</p>
<h2 id="difference-with-accessibility">Difference with accessibility</h2>
<p>While inclusive design considers from the very beginning how something might be easily useful and for as many individuals as possible, accessibility usuall means providing specific affordances for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>If we follow the definition of inclusive design of we started with, and the fact that Inclusive design is a design process, we can say that accessibility is a retrofit of our apps to address shortcomings for people with disabilities. Inclusive design, in theory, should address these shortcomings before they happen.</p>
<p>Unlike assistive devices, inclusive design doesn’t specifically target people with disabilities. While assistive devices fill in the gaps left by exclusionary design practices, inclusive design aims to evolve products beyond their conventional definitions, changing our standards for products. Assistive devices aim to remove a barrier for people with disabilities. Inclusive design strives to fundamentally redesign a product so that the barrier does not exist in the first place. Assistive technology is reactive. Inclusive design is proactive.</p>
