<h1>Revisiting D3</h1>
<p>I like data visualization and I’m sad that I don’t get to use it more often in my work.</p>
<p>I came to D3 when I was trying to create a data visualization of CSS properties as documented in the Web Platform Documentation project and shown in <a href="https://codepen.io/caraya/full/bgxhz">this Codepen</a> and shown below:</p>
<!-- <p class="codepen" data-height="689" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="caraya" data-slug-hash="bgxhz" style="height: 689px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="CSS Hierarchy Demo - D3">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/caraya/pen/bgxhz">
  CSS Hierarchy Demo - D3</a> by Carlos Araya (<a href="https://codepen.io/caraya">@caraya</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote the original visualization with D3 version 1 and upgraded it to work with version 3 and to take into account that the WPD project no longer exists.</p>
<p>D3 has changed in significant ways since I first looked at it and worked creating my visualization from an existing example.</p>
<p>This post will look at the latest version of D3, how it works and how to use it to create a visualization. I will re-create the same visualization I created in D3 1.0.</p>
