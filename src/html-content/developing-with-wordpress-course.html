<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Developing content with WordPress has become complicated over the years. While the community is moving to a React-based workflow with blocks and the full site editor, there is still a need to work with PHP in order to do thigns that are not possible to do with Gutenberg/React alone.</p>
<p>This course will cover several different way to build content with WordPress along with some auxiliary content that is necessary to prepare material to upload to your WordPress course.</p>
<h2 id="personas">Personas</h2>
<p>Rebecca is a new developer interested in WordPress. She’s created content with Laravel and Angular.</p>
<p>Peter has developed with WordPress before using PHP and HTML. He’s had limited experience with React</p>
<p>Daniel has created block themes. He wants to learn new tricks to work with as he creates new WordPress sites.</p>
<h2 id="general-objectives">General Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, participatns will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a tooling system using Gulp and Javascript</li>
<li>Explain the differences between classic and block themes</li>
<li>Describe situations when you would use classi and block themes</li>
<li>Identify cases when PHP is necessary to enhance sites</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="proposed-modules">Proposed modules</h2>
<p>I’m not 100% sure that these are modules or should each be a separate course. I’m keeping them together for now to make my life easier when writing them.</p>
<h3 id="module-1%3A-tooling">Module 1: Tooling</h3>
<p>Even though WordPress takes care of a lot of the tooling necessary to get auxiliary content like Javascript, CSS and image compression working.</p>
<p>We will look at each of these three “buckets” and build a tooling workflow for them based on Gulp.js, the same technology WordPress uses.</p>
<h4 id="module-1-objectives">Module 1 Objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a Gulp-based build and tooling system for auxiliary content for your theme</li>
<li>Explain why we’re keeping the tooling build system from the theme build system</li>
</ul>
