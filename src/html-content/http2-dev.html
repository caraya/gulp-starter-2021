<p>There may be times when we want to test our application with SSL or want to configure it and use it locally. Even though newer APIs whitrelist <code>localhost</code> for development I still would rather have HTTPS/SSL enabled to make sure that other parts of my apps work as intended</p>
<p>My preferred arpproach is to use the <code>NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS</code> <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_node_extra_ca_certs_file">environment variable</a> to give Node the path to a file containing one or more certificates that you want to use. The extra certificates are used <strong>in addition</strong> to the list of Certificate Authorities that Node already trusts.</p>
<p>For example, if I want to trust a self-signed certificate that I created on my machine, I might execute the following command in my terminal or add it to my <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token builtin class-name">export</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS</span><span class="token operator">=</span>/c/code/server.crt.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="generating-certificates-for-local-development">Generating certificates for local development</h2>
<p>If you want to generate a certificate for local development, something like this will work:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">openssl req <span class="token punctuation">\</span>
       -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout domain.key <span class="token punctuation">\</span>
       -x509 -days <span class="token number">365</span> -out domain.crt
</code></pre>
<p>Please note youâ€™ll want to set the Common Name to be <strong>localhost</strong> if you intend to work locally, as opposed to 127.0.0.1. You also need to execute all your local requests to <strong>localhost</strong> as opposed to 127.0.0.1. More info on that here.</p>
