<p>I've always been curious about why we always worry about the people who leave but seldom, if ever, about the people who return.</p>
<p>It's been 24, almost 25, years since I left Chile. Over the years I've wondered what it would be like to go back and live there. For some reason it always stays in the realm of what-if and what would happen. I've never considered, much less done it.</p>
<p>I've been back once for a few weeks for the 1999-2000 Christmas break and it terrified me. It terrified me that it had changed enough for me not to recognize it. It terrified me how much I changed to not feel comfortable there, if I ever was, and it terrified me that I couldn't wait to come back to the comfort of the familiar.</p>
<p>But time has a way to make you look at things and wonder if you did the right thing. Not as a regret but as a constant re-evaluation of where you are, where you thought you would be and where you think you want to be (it's a mouthful, I know).</p>
<p>I turn 46 in September and it will be 14 years since my dad passed away this December (as I write this).</p>
<p>There are also things that I want to do as a foreigner who wants to explore memories of who he once was and one who remembers what the past used to be.</p>
<p>Four places have been in my mind a lot recently. The towers where dad used to live and the three houses of Pablo Neruda in Isla Negra, Valparaiso and Santiago. It's a bittersweet irony that Neruda's house in Santiago (&quot;La Chascona&quot;) was less than 3 miles from my dad's apartment, yet I never visited it.</p>

&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>It is also bittersweet that I've never lived in Santiago as an adult. Don't get me wrong, <em><strong>I don't regret any of the choices I made in '94, both to leave Chile and then to stay in the US</strong></em> but I'm always evaluating where I'm at versus where I want to be and lately the “this is the place where I was born” has been nagging the back of my head.</p>
<p>The idea is to rent an apartment for between 6 and 18 months and then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit family in the north of the country</li>
<li>Chronicle what Neruda is to me now, tour the houses and take shitloads of photos</li>
<li>Reconnect with friends and people I grew up with</li>
<li>If possible, find a short term job to keep the chops working :)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's an easy thing to say but not necessarily an easy thing to do. I keep remembering the line from Poem 20: <em><strong>We of that time are no longer the same</strong></em> and it terrifies me. But, at the same time, I think I need to put those monsters to rest once and for all.</p>
<p>The older I get the more I'm coming to terms with the idea of being a tourist in the place I was born and grew up in. If it has changed so much that I'm not comfortable there, then perhaps being a tourist is the right frame of mind to be in.</p>
