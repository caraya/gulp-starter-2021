<h1>Web APIs and xQuery working together</h1>
<p>I’m starting to work with interviews. I would like to be able to get the audio transcribed to text and then store the text and the metadata about the interview in an no-sql/non-relational database that I can then query using either xQuery or regular web APIs</p>
<p>I’m researching different alternatives for a speech-to-text engine. The contenders are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/">Google speech-to-text</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/speech-api">Microsoft speech-to-text</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/">Amazon Transcribe</a></li>
</ul>
