<h1>Editor for the web (March 2022 update)</h1>
<p>I’m still looking for a good toolkit to build an editor around. Most of the solutions I’ve looked at have some sort of drawback that made me drop them from the project.</p>
<p>Even though it’s in beta, <a href="https://stylojs.com/">Stylo.js</a> may be the best solution I’ve found so far but I can’t create a menu for it so that disaqualifies it from being the solution that we want to use.</p>
