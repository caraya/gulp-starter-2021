<h1>WordPress Hooks</h1>
<p>Hooks are a way for one piece of code to interact/modify another piece of code. In the context of WordPress, they provide means for plugins, themes, and even WordPress itself to interact with WordPress core functinality.</p>
<p>If you’ve worked with Javascript and callbacks you may be familiar with the concept of callbacks.</p>
<p>There are two types of hooks: Actions and Filters. We’ll discuss them in more detail below.</p>
<p>WordPress provides many hooks that you can use, but you can also create your own so that other developers can extend and modify your plugin or theme.</p>
<h2>Filters</h2>
<p>Filters allow you to intercept and modify data as it is processed like what you need to do to add the <code>defer</code> attribute to scripts on the page or change other areas of your WordPress pages.</p>
<p>In this example we add the defer attribute to certain scripts but not others. This shold make the scripts non-render-blocking and help, a little bit, with performance.</p>
<p>The script was discussed in detail on <a href="https://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/adding-async-defer-to-wordpress-site">Adding async/defer to WordPress site</a> so I won’t go into detail about it here but the idea is that we’ve changed selected script tags before they are printed on the page.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">function rivendellweb_js_defer_attr($tag){
    // List scripts to work with
    $scripts_to_include = array(
    'prism.js',
    'fontfaceobserver.standalone.js' );

    foreach($scripts_to_include as $include_script){
            if(true == strpos($tag, $include_script ))
            // Add defer attribute
            return str_replace( ' src', ' defer src', $tag );
    }

    return $tag;

}
add_filter( 'script_loader_tag', 'rivendellweb_js_defer_attr', 10 );
</code></pre>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>Actions allow you to add functionality at specific points in the page lifecycle; for example, you might want to add an inline script to the footer of all content pages or insert additional HTML at some points of the page.</p>
<p>The hoook in the example inserts inline scripts needed to run <a href="https://fontfaceobserver.com/">Fontface Observer</a> using <a href="https://www.recursive.design/">Recursive</a> as the font, defined in CSS.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">function rivendell_add_ffo() {
?&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        const recursive = new FontFaceObserver('Recursive VF');

        recursive.load()
        .then(() =&gt; {
            console.log('Recursive has loaded.');
            sessionStorage.fontsLoaded = true;
    })
    .catch(() =&gt; {
            console.log('Recursive failed to load');
            sessionStorage.fontsLoaded = false;
        });

        // Add a class based on whether the font loaded successfully
        if (sessionStorage.fontsLoaded) {
            const html = document.documentElement;
            html.classList.add('fonts-loaded');
        } else {
            html.classList.add('fonts-failed');
        }
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;?php
};
add_action('wp_footer', 'rivendell_add_ffo');
</code></pre>
<p>The action is simple, we define a function that wraps a PHP function around an HTML <code>script</code> element and use it as the callback for a hook to <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/wp_footer/">wp_footer</a> so WordPress will insert the content of the callback function before the closing <code>body</code> tag of the page.</p>
<h2>Conclusion and further readings</h2>
<p>Actions and filters give you very fine control over your WordPress installation.</p>
<p>Their downside is that it takes some work to figure out whether it’s a filter or an action and once you’ve decided which one it is, then you have to choose which specific filter or action is the most appropriate.</p>
<p>Adam Brown provides a list of all <a href="https://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks/hook/actions">action</a> and <a href="https://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks/hook/filters">filter</a> hooks available as of WordPress 5.1. This should help you in figuring out what to use for a particular situation.</p>
