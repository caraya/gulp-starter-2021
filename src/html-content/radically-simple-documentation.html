<h1>radically simple documentation</h1>
<p>Documentation is one of the biggest problems facing any software project. Ideally, documentation should be easy for developers to create and for users to read.</p>
<p>This post will explore the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of docs as code</li>
<li>Possible tooling for docs as code</li>
<li>Creating an experimental docs as code toolchain</li>
</ul>
<h2>Docs as code</h2>
<p>The idea behind <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/">Docs as code</a> is to treat your documentation the same way you treat your project’s code; more specifically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Documentation as Code (Docs as Code) refers to a philosophy that you should be writing documentation with the same tools as code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue Trackers</li>
<li>Version Control (Git)</li>
<li>Plain Text Markup (Markdown, reStructuredText, Asciidoc)</li>
<li>Code Reviews</li>
<li>Automated Tests</li>
</ul>
<p>This means following the same workflows as development teams, and being integrated in the product team. It enables a culture where writers and developers both feel ownership of documentation, and work together to make it as good as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will follow this methodology as we dive deepeer into g3docs and a similar tool for our projects.</p>
<p>Riona MacNamara is a technical writer at Google. In her presentation at SRECon 2016 has the following <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon16europe/program/presentation/macnamara">description</a> she states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Solving this problem [poor documentation] is tough. It’s not enough to build tooling; the culture needs to change. Google internal engineering is attacking the challenge three ways: Building a documentation platform; integrating that platform into the engineering toolchain; and building a culture where documentation — like testing — is accepted as a natural, required part of the development process.</p>

<p>These are some of the goals to derive from docs as code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Docs are easy to write</li>
<li>Docs are automatically built on every commit but can also be built on demand</li>
<li>There is a UI built for compiled code</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of docs as code, we can move on to the next topic and see what other people have done to address the needs of docs as code.</p>
