<h1>Handling Responsive Images in CSS</h1>
<p>When researching material for another post I came accross an <code>image-set</code> attribute in CSS. I thought it would be interesting to take a look at how it works and whether it has any limitations we should be aware of.</p>
<p>Using <code>image-set</code> as the value of the <code>background-image</code> attribute we can add a set of images that use rules similar to what the HTML responsive images would use.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.img {
  background-image: url(examples/images/image-regular.jpg);
  background-image: 
    -webkit-image-set(
      url(examples/images/image-regular.jpg) 1x,
      url(examples/images/image-large.jpg) 2x,
    );
}
</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that, if the browser supports the image-set attribute (unprefixed or not), it will then take the appropriate image based on the display density indicated with the <code>x</code> attribute (1x for regular density screen and 2x for high density screens). If the browser doesn’t support the property it will ignore the rule.</p>
<p>As of right now only Safari and Chromium-based browsers support the <code>-webkit</code> prefixed version of image-set. According to <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-image-set">caniuse.com</a> there’s no browser, yet, that supports the unprefixed property.</p>
