<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Use the punk beer api to create a unique project that uses templating to show data on the page. If you’re ambitious, use a front end framework like React.</p>
<p>Build the app in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Template data on the page from a generic API request</li>
<li>Add a search bar, which makes a separate query to a database on request</li>
<li>Add favourite functionality which allows you to favourite a card</li>
<li>Create a separate route (using react router) which allows you to see all the beers you’ve favourited in the session.</li>
</ul>
<p>Solving these problems one step at a time will help you feel less overwhelmed and more like you’re heading in a specific direction.</p>
<p>Lastly, I find it best to eliminate styling from the equation when developing web apps and using a CSS framework. I chose to use Bulma for my example, but there are many options out there for you to explore!</p>
