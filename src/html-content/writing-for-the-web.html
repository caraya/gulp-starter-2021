<h1 id="do-people-understand-what-you're-writing%3F">Do people understand what you're writing?</h1>
<p>Let's start with the early premise of how people read online: <strong>they don't</strong>. People only skim text when reading online and we need to provide as much information as high in the page as we can before people loose interest.</p>
<p>The characteristics of good online writing, combined from <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/">How Users Read On The Web</a> from Jakob Nielsen and <a href="https://izea.com/2019/01/08/online-content-writing/">Online Content Writing</a> from IZEA.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text is scanable</strong>. Making your content easy to scan means that people will find what they need quickly and, maybe, come back when they need more information
<ul>
<li>It has highlighted <strong>keywords</strong> (hypertext links serve as one form of highlighting; typeface variations and color are others)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>It has headings</strong>. Use headings to break things up and make the content easier to scan. That way, people can easily jump to the section that is most relevant to them
<ul>
<li>meaningful <strong>sub-headings</strong> (not &quot;clever&quot; ones)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The most important info comes first</strong>. Use the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/inverted-pyramid/">inverted pyramid</a> to organize information for online reading</li>
<li><strong>It’s list-like</strong>. Lists are easy to skim and scan and also satisfy people’s need for information</li>
<li><strong>It has small paragraphs</strong>. The University of Maryland recommends <strong>fewer than 70 words</strong> per paragraph. Jakob Nielsen suggests <strong>half the word count</strong> than conventional writing. Convey <strong>one idea</strong> per paragraph</li>
<li><strong>Make it objective</strong>. People care less about your opinion than they care about the data they came to your site for</li>
</ul>

<p>The first challenge is to write content that will make sense when taken out of context. Fortunately, you can personally assess your content’s usability in the most common out-of-context scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the headline make sense if it’s all you see? Does it have sufficient information scent to attract those users who would be interested in the full story? (
<ul>
<li>It shouldn’t be misleadingly attractive to users who’d be disappointed if they clicked</li>
<li>Does the summary work to supplement the headline when the two pieces of microcontent are displayed together?</li>
<li>Is the lead picture clear? Lists use small images to represent products or articles; if your image isn’t clear, crop it if possible.</li>
</ul>
