<p>Peter,</p>
<p>Here are the ideas I have for possible events for the rest of the year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firebase
<ul>
<li>What can Firebase do? There are so many pieces to Firebase now that it may be confusing for new people to know what is available, how they interact with each other and how they interact with external tools</li>
<li>What's new?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Performance
<ul>
<li>Are we doing talk like a pirate this year?
<ul>
<li>Perceived Performance versus actual</li>
<li>Performance Patterns</li>
<li>Something from Colt?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AR and VR
<ul>
<li>State of the Union</li>
<li>WebXR
<ul>
<li>WebGL 2</li>
<li>Mixing and Matching 2d and 3d (Magic Windows and such)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DevTools (ideally both from Firefox and Chrome)
<ul>
<li>What you can do and how to do it</li>
<li>Firefox can do much more with visual tools</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Framework Showcase (show what they are and what they can do, don't try to set up a &quot;best framework&quot; battle.  It mayt also depend on who is locally available from each framework)
<ul>
<li>React</li>
<li>Angular</li>
<li>Vue</li>
<li>Ember</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CSS Evolution (What we can do with CSS that required frameworks before and how we can do it better with CSS)</li>
</ul>
