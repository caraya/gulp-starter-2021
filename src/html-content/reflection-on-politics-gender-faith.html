<p>Of the many things that the confirmation fiasco has shown me since it’s started is the kind of message that we’re sending young people (and not so young either).</p>
<p>I’m apalled at the shape that the confirmation hearing took and, to be honest, would have been extremely surprised if this hadn’t take a confrontational turn as the politics of gender and power structures have become much more sharply defined in this “administration”.</p>
<p>I’ve been apalled since the election. The people who voted for Trump did, knowingly or not, whether they accept the fact or hide it behind religious convictions or the need for change, allowed a man like Trump to become president, a man who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bragged about grapping women by the pussy</li>
<li>Has multiple acussations of sexual harrasment or sexual assault against him</li>
<li>Has enabled, supported and encouraged violence against journalists, immigrants, LGBTQ, and those who follow Islam as a religion</li>
<li>Has tried through multiple channels to make this country an evangelical christian nation (which it has never been)</li>
<li>Continually polarizes the country and the world over shit that he has no clue about</li>
<li>Thinks that his election gave him a get rich fast pass and that the laws don’t apply to him, his friends and the people in his political orbit</li>
<li>Lies as normal way of doing business and hides whatever may be inconvenient or may hinder his goals</li>
<li>Has defaulted payment to the people who have done work for him multiple times</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the strongest schock was when someone I used to respect a lot said that “The only thing that matters is who selects the next justice of the Supreme Court”. Not that we need a person of good character in the white house, not that we need someone who will not attack and demonize those who are different… instead you choose someone who will select a justice of the Supreme Court that will further your agenda and preserve your worldview no matter what the cost.</p>
<p>And the echo chamber agreed without even considering what the consequences of what they agreed to. The more I reflected on it the more I saw similar behavior around the interwebs and around my closer social circles the less I desired to be a part of those circles.</p>
<p>But what saddens/anger me the most is the world we’re leaving to those who come after us? How can we look at girls in the eyes and say we believe you and we support whatever it is that you choose to do when the truth is that it’s a lie?</p>
<p>We won’t necessarily support you if you comeout as LGBTQ.</p>
<p>We won’t necessarily support you if you’re brave enough to come forward with acussations of sexual violence against men. Boys are just being boys after all… you must have done something to trigger it.</p>
<p>What message are we giving our boys moving forward?</p>
<p>You may teach them one set of values at home but when society at large and their peers send a different message which one do you think will win?</p>
