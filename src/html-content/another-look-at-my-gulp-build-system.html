<h1>Another look at my Gulp build system</h1>
<p>Every so ofter I like to look at my build process and see where I can make improvements or changes that are necessary because the code has changed.</p>
<p>For this iteration the changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally switched to the current recommended method of defining tasks.</li>
<li>Moved from Imagemin to gulp-libsquoosh</li>
<li>Moved to markdown-it as the Markdown parser</li>
<li>The syntax for gulp-exec changed so I moved the PDF generation code to the new syntax</li>
<li>Another major and unexpected change is that node-sass is deprecated in favor of gulp-sass and the current dart-sass version
<ul>
<li>As a result the <code>sass</code> task has been  modified to run with the new gulp-sass in synchronous mode</li>
<li><strong>dart-sass is now the normative SASS version and the first one that will receive new features, updates and fixes</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dependencies
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.princexml.com/">Prince XML</a> to generate PDFs from HTML
<ul>
<li>Because it’s a commericla product I cannot share it. You can download it for evaluation purposes from the website</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/tree/dev/libsquoosh">libsquoosh</a> is used internally by gulp-libssquoosh to optimize images</li>
<li><a href="https://markdown-it.github.io/">markdown-it</a> is used to parse Markdown files</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will cover each of the top level bullets in more detail below</p>
<h2>Change to how we define tasks</h2>
<p>The first change I made was how we define tasks. Gulp 3.x used something like this to define tasks:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">gulp.task('markdown', () = {
  const config = {
    options: {
      preset: 'commonmark',
      html: true,
      xhtmlOut: true,
      linkify: true,
      typographer: true,
    },
  };
  return gulp
    .src('src/md-content/*.md')
    .pipe(markdownPlugin(config))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('src/html-content/'));
});
</code></pre>
<p>In Gulp 4.x defining tasks like we did in the past is still supported but no longer recommended. The preferred way to define tasks is to create and export a function for each task. The same task now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">function markdown() {
  const config = {
    options: {
      preset: 'commonmark',
      html: true,
      xhtmlOut: true,
      linkify: true,
      typographer: true,
    },
  };
  return gulp
    .src('src/md-content/*.md')
    .pipe(markdownPlugin(config))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('src/html-content/'));
};

exports.markdown = markdown;
</code></pre>
<p>One of the unexpected advantages of this method is that we can now create private utility functions that are used when composting tasks with <code>gulp.parallel</code> and <code>gulp.series</code> and only export those tasks we want to make available to the user.</p>
<p>Right now I expose all task in the <code>gulpfile</code> so I can run every stage of the different workflows from Gulp, but that’s not necessarily a best practice so we may change the tasks that are exported in the future.</p>
<h2>Switch to <code>gulp-libsquoosh</code></h2>
<p>Imagemin is a great tool for optimizing images but, unfortunately, the Gulp plugin leaves a lot to be desired and the codec plugins need to be compiled for every platform you use them on.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/tree/dev/libsquoosh">LibSquoosh</a> is the Javascript CLI for <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/">Squoosh</a>, an image compression application. <a href="https://github.com/pekeq/gulp-libsquoosh">gulp-libsquoosh</a> is a Gulp plugin for libSquoosh.</p>
<p>It has the advantages that supported compression formats are implemented as WASM libraries so they’ll work everywhere without compilation. If you’re doing image manipulation work, i might be possible to use them on projects outside of gulp-libsquoosh, but I haven’t tried it yet.</p>
<p>The codecs are also bundled with libsquoosh so there’s a single installation to make the full set of codices work.</p>
<h2>Switch to <code>markdown-it</code></h2>
<p>I moved the Markdown task to use <a href="https://markdown-it.github.io/">markdown-it</a> as the Markdown parser.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">function markdown() {
  const config = {
    options: {
      preset: 'commonmark',
      html: true,
      xhtmlOut: true,
      linkify: true,
      typographer: true,
    },
  };
  return gulp
    .src('src/md-content/*.md')
    .pipe(markdownPlugin(config))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('src/html-content/'));
};

exports.markdown = markdown;
</code></pre>
<p>In theory, working with Markdown-it plugins should be easier but it’s not working and rather than hold of the rest of the update I will remove the plugin code and add it once I’ve figured out how to make plugins work.</p>
<h2>Gulp-exec changes</h2>
<p>As of version 5 of <a href="https://github.com/robrich/gulp-exec">gulp-exec</a>, the plugin no longer use lodash templates. Upgrade from:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">.pipe(exec('prince --verbose \
 --input=html \
 --javascript \
 --style ./src/css/article-style.css \
 &lt;%= file.path %&gt;', options))
</code></pre>
<p>to the new syntax using ES6 template literals (broken into multiple lines for readability, should all be in one line):</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">.pipe($.exec((file) =&gt; `prince --verbose 
--input=html 
--javascript 
--style ./src/css/article-style.css 
${file.path}`, options))
</code></pre>
<p>This was a hard one to troubleshoot since the plugin doesn’t tell you what caused the error or what the specific error was. I happened to find the solution when looking at the issue tracker in the repository and the solution buried at the bottom of the README file.</p>
<h2>Changes in gulp-sass</h2>
<p><strong>dart-sass is now the normative SASS version</strong> and the first one that will receive new features, updates and fixes. LibSASS and RubySASS have been deprecated and, as far as I know, work on them continues on a best-effort basis for security patches only.</p>
<p>As a result the <code>sass</code> task has been  modified to run with the new gulp-sass in synchronous mode that uses the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass">sass</a> running dart-sass as the SASS compiler.</p>
<p>Sincce I’m evaluating whether a solution based on PostCSS plugins would be better than SASS going forward, I just wanted to get SASS working so the current solution contrinues to work.</p>
<h2>Code and docs</h2>
<p>You can look at the JSDocs for the plugin at <a href="https://caraya.github.io/gulp-starter-2021/">https://caraya.github.io/gulp-starter-2021/</a> and the build file itself on the <a href="https://github.com/caraya/gulp-starter-2021/">Github repository</a>. They will both continue to be updated as the project evolves until it’s time to release a new version.</p>
