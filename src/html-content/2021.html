<h1 id="2021">2021</h1>
<p>To say that 2021 sucked is like saying grass is green or the sky if blue… Duh!</p>
<p>I think I finally figured out what it is that has kept me in such a shitty mood over the past (few) months. Because I’ve had more time to think and reflect it has had the counter-productive effect of taking me down a rabbitt hole of questioning everything I’ve done in the last almost 30 years. Intellectually I know I did the right thing when I switched away from theater to humanities. I wish I could have stayed for another semester… it would have been fun to finish the research project and end with three degrees rather than two (overachievers are us, I know… but it comes from mom most of the time).</p>
<p>That’s why I’m looking for the validation of going back to chile, that’s why I’m looking for the validation of going back to work somewhere, that’s what’s why rejection has hit me so particularly hard (particularly the last two rejections from staffing agencies at Google), and that’s why I’m looking at integrating other areas of interest and past work into what I’m doing now.</p>
<p>But I think the pity party is over. I’m looking for recommendations for a resume writer than can give my resume a makeover so I can start from scratch since the last writer I hired sucked and cost me more than just money.</p>
<p>I’m evaluating career possibilities. I might just freelance a little, if I can, on web development. I will also review if instructional design is what I want to be doing for the next 2 to 3 years.</p>
