<p>Sounded like that’s what you said in rubbing in comments made in support of a pro democracy bill that holds Beijing to their treaty obligations (that’s her opinion). Authoritarian governments of any kind don’t have to say which system is better, they just enact laws that make anything else untennable… at least that was the experience I lived through.</p>
<p>There are many bills that Beijing claims are infringmenets on their autonomy. As far as I can tell all of them refer to protection of HK’s special status and the continuation of trade relationships between HK and the US, independent of China. Which bill is the one you referred to in your comment?</p>
<p>Yes, the situation in HK is different than the situation in the US. Lookiing at it from the outside, and after a little research, there are different governing principles at play. Please help me understand if I’m wrong in my analysis.</p>
<p>The one country, two systems principle (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_country,_two_systems">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_country,_two_systems</a>) governs both HK and Maccau, doesn’t it? Doesn’t it also guarantee that the Basic Law (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49633862">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49633862</a>) will remain as the region’s mini constitution that will be respected by the Chinese government at least as long as the Joint Declaration is in force? wasn’t that part of the Sino-British Joint Declaration (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-British_Joint_Declaration">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-British_Joint_Declaration</a>) that formalized the transfer of HK and Maccau back to Chinese control</p>
<p>The Basic Law guarantee freedom of speech and freedom of association and it also incorporate by reference the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights</a>), or did I miss something?</p>
<p>Weren’t some of the protests caused by the new law that would allow some cases to be transfered to courts in the mainland where the legal system is much harsher than those in HK?</p>
<p>I’m a strong believer that history will be a far less forgiving judge that any human can be… neither system is perfect and they all have blood on their hands. My opinion, having lived in a country where there was a coup, then there was massive restriction to personal freedom, and people died for what they believed in, is that it’s hard to believe that such a system will be better than democracy, warts and all… but we’re all entitled to our opinions, right?</p>
