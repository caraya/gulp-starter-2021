<h1 id="virtual-reality%3A-then-and-now">Virtual Reality: then and now</h1>
<p>I first became interested in virual reality while I was an undergraduate working in an Anthropology independent study project.</p>
<p>That’s where I first became interested in online games, online identity, online performance, online identity and other areas of what the internet was at the time.</p>
<p>Over time I’ve picked a more nuanced approach to these areas of interest and picked others along the way. This essay (or series of essays) seek to put down and, where possible, tie together these areas of interest in a way that makes sense and can further the research I want to do.</p>
<h1 id="setting-the-context%3A-historical-record">Setting the context: Historical record</h1>
<p>Current MMOs and fantasy games trace their lineage directly or indirectly from the earliest text-based games created by Hackers and MIT students in the 1970s. That’s where we will start our historical review.</p>
<p>Most computing work outside research centers like SRI and academic settings was limited to mainframe computers and terminal access and precursors to C for programming languages.</p>
<p>While the first communication between ARPANet hosts (UCLA and Stanford) was in October 1969, the network, as we know it today, was a long way away.</p>
<p>There was no commercial internet, at least not as we know it today; all access to the ARPANet was through terminals at Academic institutions.</p>
<p>Outside the ARPANet, most contact was through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">Bulletin Board Systems</a> with limited dial-up speeds and number of simultaneous connections dependent on the number of modems and phone lines available.</p>
<h2 id="text-based-games">Text-based games</h2>
<p>In the 1970s and 80s computers as we know them today did not exist.</p>
<h3 id="adventure">Adventure</h3>
<p>The earliest reference to a text-based computer game is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure">Colosal Cave Adventure</a> or Adventure for short.</p>
<p>The game was designed by Will Crowther for the PDP-10 mainframe computer and expanded upon in 1977 by Don Woods. In the game, the player explores a cave system rumored to be filled with treasure and gold. The game is composed of multiple locations; The player moves between these locations and interacts with objects in them by typing short commands which are interpreted by the game’s natural language input system.</p>
<p>The program acts as a narrator, describing the player’s location and the results of the player’s attempted actions. It is the first well-known example of interactive fiction, as well as the first well-known adventure game, for which it was also the namesake.</p>

</figure>
<p>Colossal Cave Adventure was one of the first teletype games and was massively popular in the computer community of the late 1970s, with numerous ports and modified versions being created based on Woods’ source code. Through its successors, it also influenced the creation of the MUD and computer role-playing game genres. In 2019 was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame by The Strong and the International Center for the History of Electronic Games.</p>

<h3 id="zork">Zork</h3>
<p>Zork was first released in 1977 by developers Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling for the PDP-10 mainframe computer.</p>
<p>The original developers and other people affiiated with MIT formed Infocom in 1979 and expanded the game into three titles which were released commercially for a variety of personal computers beginning in 1980.</p>
<p>The structure and play style of Zork is similar to Adventure and both programs act as the narrator, describing the player’s location and the results of the player’s attempted actions.</p>
<p>Blank and Joel Berez created a way to run a smaller portion of Zork on a range of microcomputers, letting them commercialize the game as Infocom’s first products. company published all three episodes beginning in late 1981.</p>
<h3 id="multiplayer-games">Multiplayer Games</h3>
<p>Both Adventure and Zork are single-player games. The next logical step is to make the games multiplayers.</p>
<h4 id="mud1%2Fessex-mud%2C-the-first-of-many">MUD1/Essex MUD, the first of many</h4>
<p>In 1978 Roy Trubshaw, a student at the University of Essex in the UK, started working on a multi-user adventure game in the MACRO-10 assembly language for a DEC PDP-10. He named the game MUD (Multi-User Dungeon), in tribute to the Dungeon variant of Zork, which Trubshaw had greatly enjoyed playing.Trubshaw converted MUD to BCPL (the predecessor of C), before handing over development to Richard Bartle, a fellow student at the University of Essex, in 1980.</p>
<p>The game revolved around gaining points till one achieved the Wizard rank, giving the character immortality and special powers over mortals.</p>
<p>MUD1 or Essex MUD ran on the University of Essex network, and became more widely accessible when a guest account was set up that allowed users on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JANET">JANET</a> academic computer network to connect on weekends and between the hours of 2 AM and 8 AM on weekdays. It became the first Internet multiplayer online role-playing game in 1980, when the university connected its internal network to ARPANet.</p>
<p>MUD1 game was closed down in late 1987, reportedly under pressure from CompuServe, to whom Richard Bartle had licensed the game. This left MIST, a derivative of MUD1 with similar gameplay, as the only remaining MUD running on the University of Essex network. MIST ran until the machine that hosted it, a PDP-10, was retired in early 1991.</p>
<p>1985 saw the birth of a number of projects inspired by the original MUD, both free and commercial.</p>
<p>We’ll look at two flavor of MUD descedants</p>
<h4 id="dikumud">DikuMud</h4>
<h4 id="tinymud">TinyMUD</h4>
<p>TinyMUD is a descedant of Essex MUD and created some of the concepts we still see indirectly in our modern computer games.</p>
