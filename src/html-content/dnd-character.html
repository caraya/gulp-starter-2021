<p>Peter,</p>
<p>Attached is the background for my character. Use it as you wish and nix whatever aspect of the background as you need</p>
<hr>
<p>Liesel was a war wizard apprentice. He participated in several military campaigns and grew to enjoy using magic to support the front-line grunts that were assigned to his unit.</p>
<p>It was in one of these missions that his group was ambushed. All the soldiers died and he was severely wounded. He was saved by the team sent to reinforce his group, his friends, his family.</p>
<p>After that, he left the military and wandered aimlessly doing random odd jobs to survive and traveling. It wasn't long before he arrived to Waterdeep where he has found some semblance of peace.</p>
<p>At first he was approached by The Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors as a potential member.  Tired of running away Liesel decided to join the order and teach, trying to forget the friends he lost, not always successfully. He's still a light sleeper and a later worker and researcher as a means to avoid nightmares, and also because the libraries and the labs are not used as much at night.</p>
<p>Old habits die hard and it wasn't long before he joined the city guard for random missions. He's still in, somewhat, good terms with them.</p>
<p>Personality Traits</p>
<p>I try to keep people at a distance. I'm afraid that I won't be able to save new friends like I wasn't able to save my old army buddies.</p>
<p>I am horribly, horribly awkward in social situations.</p>
<p>Ideals</p>
<p>No Limits. Nothing should fetter the infinite possibility inherent in all existence. (Chaotic)</p>
<p>Flaws</p>
<p>Most people scream and run when they see a demon. I stop and take notes on its anatomy.</p>
