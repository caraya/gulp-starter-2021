<p>When you’re writing technical resources you want to make sure you go direct to the point. Clear, concise text with a minimum of extra words is most helpful to users.</p>
<p>It also reminds me of we were taught to write instructional material. Write short sentences, make the point as fast as possible and chunk the content in small self-contained fragments.</p>
<p>Some items worth considering when writing technical material:</p>
<p><strong>Do not include the obvious.</strong> Don’t end the instructions with obvoius things like <em>Click OK [to close the dialog]</em> unless “the obvious” is followed by additional instructions or behavior that needs to be described.</p>
<p><strong>Use short sentences, simple sentence structures, and simple words.</strong> Avoid extra words and keep content simple and easy to read.</p>
<p><strong>If there is extra information that will be useful to some users, consider putting it in an expanding or drop-down hotspot, hyperlink to a separate page, a pop-up or similar alternative.</strong> This will make the visible text shorter, while still providing the extra information for those to need it.</p>
<p><strong>Strive for consistency.</strong> Whenever possible, use the same words for the same thing. Resist the temptation to use synonyms to make text “more interesting” to read.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid long paragraphs.</strong> Divide long sets of instructions into shorter tasks.</p>
<p><strong>You don’t need to document every aspect of the product.</strong> Users can play with the product on their own and discover additional functionality.</p>
