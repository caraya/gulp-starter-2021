<p>&quot;commander, we have an unknown signal.&quot; The helmsman reported from his station.</p>
<p>That got my attention... the scanners had been clear for the last 8 hours and there was no way something that big could have snuck inside our scanner's range without us noticing.</p>
<p>&quot;What the fuck is that thing?&quot;, I heard the science officer mutter from her station. This made me raise an eyebrow, she was not known for that kind of outbursts, or any kind for that matter.</p>
<p>&quot;Come to a full stop.&quot; Now I was starting to get a little concerned. &quot;Sensor report.&quot;</p>
<p>The science and engineering officers, along with the helmsman and the tactical officers all raised their heads from the sensor screen and looked at each other, before letting the science officer make the report.</p>
<p>&quot;Commander, it appears to be a ship. Origin unknown. No lifesigns. Her engines seem to be dormant, we have no way of knowing if they are functional or not.&quot;</p>
<p>This was getting more and more interesting.</p>
<p>&quot;Lifesigns?&quot;</p>
<p>The science officer shook their head. &quot;None, sir... either no one is alive or our sensors can't find them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;send the combat air patrol to do a flyby and get the ready-5 ships ready to launch. Tell commander Allen to be careful.&quot;</p>
<p>The communications officer grunted her understanding as her hands flew over her console with the instructions I just gave.  There was an uncomfortable pause as FAS-38s goot closer to the unknown ship.</p>
