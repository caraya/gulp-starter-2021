<h1>Treating Books As Software</h1>
<p>Brad Neuberg’s <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/ebooks/html/blog/books_as_software.html">Transforming eBook Production by Treating Books as Software</a> as a possible suggestion of how to handle books as software with all the advantages that it entails.</p>
<p>I like the idea but I don’t think it goes far enough. I can’t tell when the article was written but there have been changes in the software world that make it easier to use some software over others.</p>
<p>Before we look at the technology let’s see what the minimal required assets to build an epub ebook.</p>
<ul>
<li>XML files</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<p>To these basic assets we can add more:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Additional Fonts beyond those offered in reading devices</li>
<li>Audio</li>
<li>Video</li>
</ul>
<p>These bundles can be very complicated. For example, a large book may have more than 50 chapters of text and images. Now add interactivity, and educational content. If you’re not careful you will need a small army to produce every eBook.</p>
<p>So how do we build these different types of files? how do we store them? How do we allow for collaborative development?</p>
<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>If we want to treat book production we should consider the appropriate tooling for it.  Some of the tools we need may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Source control systems</li>
<li>Issue databases</li>
<li>Build systems</li>
<li>Testing</li>
</ul>
<h2>What type of application?</h2>
<p>In recent years we’ve seen the concept of progressive web applications become prevalent on web development and, at some point, I wrote about a combination of PWA and <a href="https://craigmod.com/journal/subcompact_publishing/">subcompact publishing</a> (a concept and philosophy first proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/craigmod/">Craig Mod</a>) that I called <em>subcompact publishing</em>.</p>
<p>However, as interesting as subcompact publishing is, we should look at building our content as a regular web site and then add PWA features on top of it.</p>
<h2>Build your content</h2>
<h2>Build a manifest</h2>
<h2>Build a service worker</h2>
