  <p>What happens when two states have different opinions on what the law is? Particularly elements of the constitution that were written after the original was ratified? Should we apply a strict federalist interpretation to those too?</p>
<p>Yes, there are thousands of interpretations for the amendment, but why don’t we just look at the text, since we shouldn’t fall into the times are changing fallacy the text itself should be the deciding factor, right?</p>
<p>The text says: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” It doesn’t mention the parents’ immigration status or any other detail.</p>
<p>As I said earlier… the 14th is a politically hot topic and that makes it a good test subject for Trump. If the administration takes any action it will land in the Supreme Court and I don’t believe they will be able to dodge it this time… refusing to hear the cases will only make it worse…</p>
