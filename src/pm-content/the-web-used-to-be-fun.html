  <h1>The web used to be fun</h1>
<p>Another aspect of the discussion about performance is to ask outselves what we loose when we make performance the primary focus of our work on the web.</p>
<p>This tweet from Sarah Drasner made me think about another aspect of performance.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wrote a small article, called &quot;In Defense of a Fussy Website&quot;<br><br>In it, I talk about sites I love, like <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JoshWComeau</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/devopsjay?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@devopsjay</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/cassiecodes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cassiecodes</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/stripe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@stripe</a> ✨ and also how we might be headed the wrong direction generally for UI/UX.<a href="https://t.co/rRaA6mzdNC">https://t.co/rRaA6mzdNC</a></p>&mdash; Sarah Drasner (@sarah_edo) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1276921742150135813?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>The thread associated with the post is illustrative, not just because of the multiple examples that people talk about but also because of a challenge Sarah poses for other developers.  <strong><em>What little detail can we add to our sites and apps that will make users notice our site/app over the hundred or thousand other sites they see every day?</em></strong></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What if you don’t have the time? We all have to get things over the line. Perhaps a challenge: what small thing can you incorporate that someone might notice? Can you start with a single detail?</p>&mdash; Sarah Drasner (@sarah_edo) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1276924598689230848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>The conversation evolved into what, to me, is the most important part of the conversation: How do we quantify user enjoyment?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Agree! Measuring an increase in engagement seems like a great place to start. Delight being hard to quantify has made it trickier to convince some that animations and subtle UI treatments are very much worth the time on the web. Hope we see more inspired to try.</p>&mdash; Addy Osmani (@addyosmani) <a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1277080695643320323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
