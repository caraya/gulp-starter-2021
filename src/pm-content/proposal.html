  <p>When a new feature is proposed it should include a paragraph or two about hat happens if the reader doesn’t support the feature and doesn’t support the polyfill, if there is a fallback to a core media type, if we’re ok with the feature not working in all devices or if we’ve developed a polifill and how we expect it to work.</p>
<p>If it’s an API we should have feature detection as part of the initial API design proposal and have the option of a polifill available for implementors to choose if they will  implement it.</p>
