  <p><a href="https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment">A Test-Driven JS Assessment</a> gives you a different way to learn by reversing the learning experience. It consists of a  set of failing tests that cover various JavaScript topics and requires you to you write code to make the tests pass, can you?</p>
<p>One final way to learn is by looking code others have written. <strong>10 things I learned from the jQuery Source</strong> is an oldvideo from Paul Irish that shows what you can learn by reading other peopleâ€™s code. Although it was written for jQuery, a lot of it can be applied outside jQuery and any other framework or library.</p>
