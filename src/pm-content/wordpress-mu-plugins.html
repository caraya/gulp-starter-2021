  <h1>WordPress Must Use (MU) Plugins</h1>
<p>While researching Custom Post Types I found a little known technique to ensure plugins are installed and run regardless user interaction.</p>
<p>The idea is that the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/must-use-plugins/">Must Use Plugins</a> will be active by default and administrators will not be able to remove them from the admin Plugins GUI, making the must-use directory the perfect place to put code that must run to make the installation work, possibly like CPT and other customization plugins that we want/need to run indepdent of the theme we use.</p>
<p>Must-use plugins are not perfect. For all the advantages that they offer, they also have several and disadvantages that may render them less useful than you first thought</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantages</strong>
<ul>
<li>MU Plugins are always-on
<ul>
<li>No need to enable via admin</li>
<li>Administrators and users cannot disable them other than by deleting the plugin from the directory manually</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can be enabled by uploading file to the mu-plugins directory, No login necessary</li>
<li>PHP loads Must-Use plugins in alphabetical order <strong><em>before normal plugins</em></strong>, meaning API hooks added in an mu-plugin apply to all other plugins</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages and Caveats</strong>
<ul>
<li>Plugins in the must-use directory will not appear in the update notifications nor show their update status on the plugins page
<ul>
<li>You are responsible for learning about and performing updates to these plugins</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WordPress only looks for PHP files right inside the mu-plugins directory, and not for files in subdirectories
<ul>
<li>You may want to create a proxy PHP loader file inside the mu-plugins directory that loads all the plugins your must-use plugins</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference#register_activation_hook">Activation hooks</a> are not executed in plugins added to the must-use plugins folder
<ul>
<li>These hooks are used by many plugins to run installation code that sets up the plugin initially and/or uninstall code that cleans up when the plugin is deleted</li>
<li>Plugins depending on these hooks may not function in the mu-plugins folder</li>
<li>You should test all plugins  specifically in the mu-plugins directory before being deployed to a live site</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
