  <h2>Setting a base value for body element</h2>
<p>Over time I realized that the pain in the ass of defining the root to be 10 pixels was not the right way to do it. More research is needed.</p>
<h3>Specific Values</h3>
<p>I started playing with setting different fixed sizes for fonts. Iâ€™ve settled in 16 pixels as my default and 12 points (pt) when working with long form content.</p>
<p>The large point size makes the content easier to read and is consistent with printed formats. Both 12 and 16 also make it easier to do the math when deciding on what size to make other elements: If using 12pt we know that 2em will equal 24 and when using 16px we know that 2em will equal 32px and so on.</p>
<p>There are times when it would be nice to have a ready-made list of sizes to apply to elements?</p>
<p>Enter Type Scales.</p>
