<p>today and tomorrow feel weird</p>
<p>it’s remembering the past and the dislocation of travels, of endings and new beginnings with the distance of time between this and many other inflection points and you.</p>
<p>today (26) it’s 28 years since I left Chile to move to the US for what I thought (perhaps naively) would only be four years of university before I got to move back. Or perhaps the naive thought was to think I had a choice whether to move back or not.</p>
<p>i make the distinction between the 26 and the 27 of march because there was a transtion there… a time when you left Chile but you have yet to arrive to the US.</p>
<p>It’s also a reminder of how much people and things change and how different you become in time and how things that seemed harmless and normal in the past are now deal breakers and much, much more complicated.</p>

<p>today (27) is 28 years since the first day of my life in the US. I still have mental images of the immigration center in Miami and the mountains of people who were waiting to do immigration paperwork and how much it screwed up my plans.</p>
<p>I still remember the kindness of the airline agent who rebooked my whole itinerary from Miami to Vermont and I still remember how much operators (remember them?) didn’t like it when you left messages in an answering machine when you called collect.</p>
<p>I still marvel at how things have worked out and how much I have learned, grown and changed as a result.</p>
<p>Yes, there are things I regret, we all have them and we all deal with them in different ways, but I think it’s important to continue moving forward.</p>
