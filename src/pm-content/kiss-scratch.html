  <h1>Complexity</h1>
<p>This tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov">Dan Abramov</a> made me think about complexity, how do we define it, why have our apps become so complicated to build and whether all that complexity is necessary.</p>
<h2>The tweet</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JS show idea: developer is given requirements for a modern interactive webapp but they’re only allowed to use tools from five years ago (before front-end became complicated).</p>&mdash; Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1004403873937854465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>Later on in the thread Dan (creator of React) states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My point is that much of the tech I’m seeing popular today (eg webpack) helps solve problems that I found very challenging 5 years ago (eg code splitting). YMMV</p>
<p>And that was sort of in response to the sentiment that tools just replace each other like fads for no good reason because developers like complexity. (It’s sometimes said as a joke but some people genuinely feel that way)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been in my min</p>
