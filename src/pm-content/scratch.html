  <p>(1974- ) Graduated from Central College in 1998 with a B.A in theater, he worked for 5 years with community theaters in vermont before enrolling in the Media Arts and Science program of the MIT where, in colaboration with a group of clasmates, worked in the development of a graphical user interface for MUDs on the internet . His group worked on developing further applications of MUDs to education and in the further development on interactive theater.
He stayed at MIT for 5 years where he obtained both a M.A and a Ph.D in Media Arts and sciences. He was later appointed as instructor in the Epistemology and learning program of the institute and was awarded the teaching excellence award for his innovative teaching techniques.</p>
<p>Perhaps he is better know for his efforts in promoting MUDs as a viable alternative of distance learning. He took the ideas presented by Dr. Barry Kort (the creator of MUSEnet and MicroMUSE) and took them to their extreme. He created several graphical MUDs on the Internet and gathered round him a group of dedicated students who served as administrators. It is interesting to note that several of these students later entered in to the computer science and education fields, helping spread and extend the concept of virtual school.</p>
<p>He now works as consultant for several school districts in New England and the Mid West and teaches a class about educational uses of MUDs at MIT. He has published several books and articles related to Multimedia in the classroom, MUDing as a way of learning and new applications of Logo to education.</p>
