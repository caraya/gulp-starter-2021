  <h1>The latest Javascript controversy and how I‚Äôm trying to understand it</h1>
<p>There is a proposal on TC39‚Äôs Github Repo for <code>array.flatten</code> and <code>array.flattenMap</code> and a <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-flatMap/pull/56">pull request</a> to rename it to Smoosh because <a href="https://mootools.net">MooTools</a> implemented the feature in incompatible ways by extending <code>array.Prototype</code>. While there is an <a href="https://github.com/mootools/mootools-core/issues/2797">issue open</a> in the MooTools repository to change the signature to match the proposal but it‚Äôll never fully solve the issue; there are a lot of sites that will break if MooTools change its implementation and several of those sites are no longer maintained.</p>
<p>It is not the first time that MooTools conflicts with the ES6. In 2012 MooTool implementation of <code>array.contains</code> <a href="https://github.com/mootools/mootools-core/issues/2402">different than the ES6 version</a></p>
