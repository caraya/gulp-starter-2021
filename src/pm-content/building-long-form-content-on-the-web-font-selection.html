  <h1 id="selecting-fonts-is-not-as-simple-as-it-seems">Selecting fonts is not as simple as it seems</h1>
<p>I’m not a type designer and I consider myself adequate as a user of fonts on the web, but I’ve been around for the full progression of fonts on the web.</p>
<p>We will not review the full history of web fonts in this post. If interested you can read the history on <a href="https://www.typotheque.com/articles/brief_history_of_webfonts">Brief History of Webfonts</a></p>
<h2 id="font-selection">Font selection</h2>
<p>The first decision we need to make is what font we want to use. It is a deceptively simple question since it is not just a matter of picking up a font that looks nice.</p>
<p>I follow this list, taken from Google Fonts <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/choosing_type/a_checklist_for_choosing_type">A checklist for choosing type</a>. It provides a good overview of what’s necessary to choose a font for your project.</p>
<ul>
<li>The typeface suits the purpose of the project
<ul>
<li>Its personality will prompt the appropriate emotional response(s) from our audience</li>
<li>Its design fits the intended use</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The typeface’s design is comprehensive
<ul>
<li>It has enough multi-language support</li>
<li>It contains legible details</li>
<li>It has at least the basic weights and styles
<ul>
<li>Even better: It has alternate glyphs</li>
<li>Even better: It has additional weights and styles (or grades)</li>
<li>Even better: It has multiple widths</li>
<li>Even better: It has different optical sizes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The font files are reliable
<ul>
<li>All of the design features checked above are actually included in the font files being used</li>
<li>The fonts are properly spaced</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The fonts are usable in the situation(s) required
<ul>
<li>If serving as a secondary typeface to a primary choice, there’s a suitable balance between distinction and harmony</li>
<li>We have, or our client has, the appropriate font license(s)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Asking these questions prepares you in terms of font usefulness, potential cost and licensing issues that you may run into.</p>
<p>One thing that is important to consider is that most, if not all, foundries have a usage cap when you buy the license.</p>
<p>The license for a font use on the web will have some kind of text like <strong>10000 page views per month</strong> or similar. This is important because foundries have a way to enforce these values and may require you to buy a larger license (more pageviews and higher cost) if you go over the pageviews covered in your license.</p>
