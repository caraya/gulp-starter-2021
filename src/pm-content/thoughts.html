  <p>Big rant ahead… Been holding this one for a while and decided that today was as good a day as any.</p>
<p>The more I think about what’s going on in the US today I’m reminded of Chile in the 70’s and 80s and how we wed to our ideas and our causes (political and otherwise) more faithfuly than we wed our spouses or embrace our faith.</p>
<p>In Chile it was political ideology that created the chasms that are not yet (if ever will be) fully healed. What is it in the US? I’m afraid that we’re attacking that which makes us uncofmortable, that which is different and those who represent different ideas from us. Why is America so afraid of immigrants and of families that want to be reuinted? What’s their sin? The color of their skin? The fact that they will take jobs Americans don’t want but bitch about anyways? Where will the fear end? When will it end? How will it end?</p>
<p>I remember hearing of people who died and who are yet to be found, people who were tortured for their political beliefs and then exiled, kicked out of the country because of those same beliefs rendered them unfit for the military regime of the day to allow them the freedom to live in their home country. Sounds familiar? Don’t let them in or, if they are already here, kick them out! They don’t have the right to be here! it doesn’t matter how long they’ve lived here or whether they had any input on their coming over</p>
<p>Right now the US has married a so-called christian agenda with a very powerful gun lobby to get where we the US is now… we attack that which is different and we do nothing when 50+ people die in a music concert. We do absolutely nothing when 17 children and teachers die because a punk who was kicked out decided to get even. As the son of a teacher in a district with high suicide rates, it scares the shit out of me that some kid from my mom’s school may decide that a gun is better than suicide by Caltrain at 3am and want to see how many of them he/she can take before punching out.</p>
<p>To the asshole who told me that gun control didn’t work and to deal with it. I won’t “deal with it” while politicians do nothing to fix the problem. I will not deal with it and be afraid to leave my apartment. No, a weapon will not make me feel better, and no, a weapon will not solve the issue of violence on the street… it’ll make it worse. It will not help the family of a little girl who was shot by mistake when playing outside her house in Oakland, California; should we have given her a bulletproof vest? There are many examples like hers where the only sin someone committed was be in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
<p>We’ve lost empathy and we lost the ability to see good in each other. We’ve lost basic human decency. I will not speak about politics directly (you all know my opinion of the man in the White House) but it’s naive, stupid and dangerous to think this is not a political issue.</p>
<p>It’s naive because we’ve politicized every fucking thing in this country.</p>
<p>It is stupid because the NRA and other conservative groups have already invested tens of millions of dollars buying members of congress to do their biding; just look at the correlation between NRA donations and voting record and tell me their contributions don’t make a difference.</p>
<p>It’s dangerous because the more we condone shit like this the more radical people will feel emboldened to spew out their “opinions” and put more garbage into the country’s thought stream where impressionable young people will decide that violence is the answer or that if they are going to go they may as well take a few others with them.</p>
<p>It is true that 64% of weapon related deaths in 2016 were caused by handguns and 34% by other kinds of weapons. I ask honestly… how many deaths are too many? What would it take to change your mind about gun control? Do you really think a good guy with a gun will make a difference?</p>
