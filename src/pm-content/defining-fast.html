  <h1 id="how-do-we-define-fast%3F">How do we define fast?</h1>
<p>One thing that has struck me over the last few years is our obsession with fast. The faster, the better, right?</p>
<p>I’ve become interested on how do we define fast. Is a page that loads in 10 milliseconds instead of 5 slow? Is a page that shows you above-the-fold content in 150 miliseconds slow?</p>
<p>This became even more interesting in the context of this article from <a href="https://gomakethings.com/javascript-selector-performance/">gomakethings</a> about performance in the context of selector speed.</p>
<p>So how fast is fast enough? Is there such a thing as too fast?</p>
<p>IF we take the <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/">Core Web Vitals</a> as an example, if a site takes 1.2 seconds to load in a fast 3G mobile connection, is it slow, even when it’s not optimal? How do this absolute values relate to how users perceive speed?</p>
