  <p>“Oh, shit… not again…” Coddie began working on the terminal trying to troubleshoot what the problem was this time.</p>
<p>A female voice came over the speakers, teasing and mocking; “You know you won’t keep me out for long, handsome… it’s only a matter of time before I get into that system of yours and break it all the way.”</p>
<p>Coddie frowned as his fingers kept typing and trying to figure out how to lock the system in a way she wouldn’t expect it.</p>
<p>As his fingers typed, his mind wondered to a time when things were simpler and computers were not used as weapons of war. Coddie and his generation were spared the attrocities of the war… too old to be fully implanted and trained to fight in it and too young to be part of the recovery details that scoured the battlefields after the battles.</p>
<p>But a general realized that they were not too old to work the computers that managed the battlefield. Some of the old timers kept yapping about science fiction and fantasy novels where children actually saved the day.</p>
<p>They were taken out of their homes and they were put through rigurous mental, physical and technical training. In two short years they had become some of the top hackers and programmers in the world and out of it too.</p>
<p>The other countries in the world, and their colonies on the moon and elsewhere didn’t know what hit them. They couldn’t tell how the information was taken and how it appeared in open markets a short time later, likely after whoever had taken made good use of it.</p>
<p>The countermeasures didn’t matter. Dedicated counter intrussion and detection teams were useless. Nothing seemes able to stop the ghost hackers.</p>
<p>The government that created the program was ecstatic. For the children this was a living hell.</p>
<p>The leader of the program had warned government to be careful about how they handled the kids and to keep their identities, and those of their families, a secret. The government was desperate for good news about conflicts happening around settled worlds revealed the existance of the new team.</p>
<p>Things began to unravel from that point on. Successes continued but at a far slower rate. The enemeies seemed better prepared and the items the kids were looking for were better hidden, no matter what new strategies the kids used.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long to discover a leak. A family member who fell in hard times with drugs was used as leverage over a young girl, Angela, and she in turn turned over operations and tactical procedures to a foreign power. Right before she was aprehended she fled to parts unknown.</p>
