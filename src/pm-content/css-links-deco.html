  <h1>Playing with link styles</h1>
<p>First we had links that were underlined, next we had links and the capability to underline text with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/u">u</a> element.</p>
<p>Then we wanted more control of what we could do with underlines so we moved to using <code>border-bottom</code> for our underlining playground because it gave us more flexibility than what the native underlinining tools gave us at the time.</p>
<p>But now Firefox has introduced new text-decoration and text-underline rules that make it easier to customize our underlines to do what we want to do.</p>
<p><strong>As far as I know and tested, <code>text-decoration-thickness</code> and <code>text-underline-offset</code> are Firefox only for now.</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-scss">a {
  text-decoration-thickness: 3px; // 1
  text-underline-offset: 6px; // 2
  color: #ff2908; // 3
  text-decoration-color: rebeccapurple; // 4
  text-decoration-skip-ink: auto; // 5
  text-decoration-style: solid; // 6
}
</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that we can declare rules to better control underlines and it’s characteristics. The rules do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-thickness">text-decoration-thickness</a> sets the thickness of the underline</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-underline-offset">text-underline-offset</a> sets the offset distance of an underline line from its original position</li>
<li><code>color</code> determines the color of the link</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-color">text-decoration-color</a> sets the color of decorations</li>
<li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/text-decoration-skip-ink/">text-decoration-skip-ink</a> controls the behavior of underline and overline (but not line-through) when the line passes above the top or hang below the bottom of a line.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-style">text-decoration-style</a> indicates what type of line to use in the underline</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t think we need to wrap this in a feature query since the browsers that don’t understand thickness and offset will ignore them but keep the ones it understands. So now we have a way to progressively enhance the way our underlined elements look without resorting to hacks.</p>
