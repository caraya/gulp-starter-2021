  <h1 id="micro-front-ends">Micro front-ends</h1>
<p>Over the last few years I’ve been working at understanding micro front ends, what they are and how they work.</p>
<p>I think I’m finally understanding what micro frontends are, how they work and why they are important for large scale projects. This post is my attempt at documenting my understanding.</p>
<h2 id="micro-frontends">Micro frontends</h2>
<p>The idea behind micro front ends is related to microservices. As a project grows, it becomes segmented with different teams building different parts of the project.</p>
<p>It would make the most sense for the team building the feature to also build the frontend and UI for that feature as well.</p>
