  <h1>To Siu</h1>
<p>You lost me…</p>
<p>You said, or implied, that you were not willing to put the work required to accomplish your goals. That, to me, is a cardinal sin. A piss poor excuse that you use when you don’t want to do something and you can’t come up with anything better. It’s a million times better to try and fail than not to try at all.</p>
<p>Did you know that Sia Cooper, the woman who runs Diary of a fit mommy, sells both exercise and meal plans? So you don’t have to plan or even guess what to do, it’s all done for you, you just have to do it.  If you’re so sure you can’t do it, did you ask her how she managed to accomplish it with/after two kids? Does it matter or do you look at her just because she’s hot and you wish you could bang her?</p>
<p>But you’re not willing to change… even if the change is minimal and the discipline required is nowhere near as hard as as you think it is.</p>
<p>I understand now why your therapist told you to get out of the lifestyle. You don’t want a dominant or a master. You want a FWB that will do whatever you want, however you want and whenever you want. His feelings or desires be damned</p>
<p>Another thing that bothered me is that you assume too many things of a relationship and want things your way or not at all. A collar for me is not a given, it’s something a sub/slave has to work really hard to earn and it’s not a promise ring or anything like it; submission and love are two different but inter related things. If the dominant loves you he will put a ring on your finger, just like anyone else.</p>
<p>Fantasies are born from reality… when you tell me that your fantasy is hedonism and be a sugar baby, it tells me a lot about where your brain is… you want everything given to you without you having to do anything to achieve it… because it’s not what the suggar daddy wants, it’s what he wants as long as it matches your requirements, same thing with a dominant.</p>
<p>It’s a self-defeating fantasy because you don’t want to put the work into becoming the sexy woman that’s hidden inside you because you know yourself and you’re not willing to do it and don’t realize that your mindset is the first thing that has to change before you can reach your goals… FWIW, I know that from first-hand experience</p>
<p>You’ll never divorce… I’ve realized that over the last few weeks as I got to know the real you. There is too much for you to loose without an equivalent reward. The momemnt Karl said you’d have to apply to be the nanny of your kids I realized you were never going to make it… There are hundred if not thusand more qualified people than you to be nannies and Karl knows about the edibles and the weed-related stuff.</p>
<p>I don’t work that way so, again, you lost me. I know you will have tons of reasons and excuses for what you do and what you want and that they may sound perfectly reasonable to you. That’s fine… but I don’t want any part of it.</p>
