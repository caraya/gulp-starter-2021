  <h1>Creating arrays from node lists</h1>
<p>Using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll">querySelectorAll</a> to get one or more items and then process them as an array of items is not as straight forward as I initially thought it would be, at least in the browsers I use for testing</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that <code>querySelectorAll</code> returns a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList">node list</a> and some of them will not work with node lists and will require the conversion to an array before we do anything.</p>
<p>We’ll look at three ways to work with node lists as arrays. The last one works with node lists directly. The examples will each take all the paragraphs on a page and then print the content of each paragraph to the console. They will also indicate what version of the ECMAScript specification the feature was first introduced in.</p>
<h2>Convert to array with spread syntax</h2>
<p>The first way I found to convert a node list to an array is to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax">spread syntax</a> to include the <code>rawData</code> iterable in the array.</p>
<p>I always do this as a two-step process to make sure I do it right. The code for this version of the example looks like this.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const rawData = document.querySelectorAll(&quot;p&quot;);
const myParagraphs = [...rawData];

array.forEach
myParagraphs.forEach((paragraph) =&gt; {
  console.log(paragraph.innerText);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Spread syntax is available since ES2015/ES6. It should be safe to use.</p>
<h2>Convert to array with array.from</h2>
<p>Another way to create an array from our <code>rawData</code> node list is to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from">array.from</a> to generate the array.</p>
<p>The code for this example is almost identical to the spread syntax example; the only difference is how we generate the <code>myParagraphs</code> array.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const rawData = document.querySelectorAll(&quot;p&quot;);
const myParagraphs = array.from(rawData);

//array.forEach
myParagraphs.forEach((paragraph) =&gt; {
  console.log(paragraph.innerText);
});
</code></pre>
<p><code>array.from</code> is also available since ES2015/ES6.</p>
<h2>nodeList.forEach</h2>
<p>The biggest surprise when I was researching this post is that the <code>nodeList</code> interface also has a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList/forEach">forEach</a> method.</p>
<p>This means that, in the end, we don’t need to convert the node list to an array if all we want to do is run <code>forEach</code> on it.</p>
<p>This example uses <code>nodeList.forEach</code> to run the same example. The code is less complex since we don’t have to convert the node list to an array.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const rawData = document.querySelectorAll(&quot;p&quot;);

// Nodelist.forEach
rawData.forEach((paragraph) =&gt; {
  console.log(paragraph.innerText);
});
</code></pre>
<p>This method was introduced in ES2016/ES7 so it should be safe to use.</p>
<p>As usual with code, test it on your target browsers to make sure they work.</p>
