  <p>Youwan,</p>
<p>I’ve debated whether to send this out because I’m not really keen on starting a debate whether the church is doing what’s right and whether challenging the positions of established christians is the best way to go</p>
<p>You’ve forgotten how to be kind, how to take religion as a tool of compassion and learning. You choose to ignore that what makes us different is a strength to be appreciated and not something to be afraid of or discriminate on the basis on.</p>
<p>Christians cherry picks the wwrong verses to build a case for exclusion. Rather than taking any of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matthew 5:43-48</li>
<li>Mark 12:28-29</li>
<li>Matthew 22:33-40</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead you chose verses that reafirm your world view… what’s that called? Cofirmation Bias?</p>
<p>I’ve had bad experiences both in church an outside. When the wife of an elder comes asking for signatures for a political campaing on church grounds (which, by the way, is illegal) because she claimed that the democratic candidate was against “traditional” marriage. When I pointed out that it was not true, she became dimissive and just turned away and said “what do you know…”</p>
<p>“All that matters is who gets to choose the next justice of the supreme court.” Beyond being a lie of the biggest caliber it hurts people who don’t need any futher harm coming to them from Christians and some people who you’ve interacted and shared with.</p>
<p>You knew the people you want to choose judges aree also against providing health care for all… It goes beyond the poor and the people most conservatives say are “milking the system”. I bet you know more than one person who’s been pregnant, had cancer or any number of conditions that will render them unable to get insurance beyond employer plan.  How many of those people will have to make radical changes to their lifestyles because they will not be able to get healtcare from now on?</p>
<p>You wanted political change and you didn’t care that you put an abusive, misogynist, young man in power.  A man who has no problem with attempting to discredit media that doesn’t toe the line, who “grabs a woman by the pussy” (what would happen if that woman was related to you by the way?) and who has absolutely no problem advocating violence against those who disagree with him (and who is too coward to accept the consequence of his actions). All that mattered was who got to choose the next justice of the Supreme Court, eh? So was it worth it? Was it worth to keep hearing Graham and Falwell still spewing platitudes about Trump, most of which are balatant lies? Is it worth your soul to gain political power?</p>
<p>Christians mock LGBTQI people and their supportes yet don’t consider that your children or those who you know and care about may be in those groups now or in the future. So let me ask you this: What would you do if your child comes to you and says &quot;dad/mom, I’m gay/lesbian? or “I don’t belong in this body?” Will that child be ostracized? Will you make his/her life a living hell just to show how pious you are? The worst part is that whenever someone has the balls to proclaim publically that his/her views on homosexuality have changed you hammer him down, you threaten him and you force him to “recant his incorrect views” whether he actually means it or not. Do you think we’re that stupid not to notice that he’s not changing his views to</p>
<p>You mock the immigrant and now crops will not be harvested because those US citizens who you claim would have taken the jobs will not take them because they are too hard or they don’t pay enough.</p>
<p>You stand silent when your president (or your party’s candidate for the presidency) mocks a disabled journalist, you remain silent when he’s accused of rape, of screwing employees and business partners from money they are rightfully owned (hell, even one of his polsters quit because he wasn’t paid). Had this been a democrat you’d be up in arms but then, this is hipocrisy at its finest</p>
<p>you fight over abortion… to me the answer is simple: if you don’t want abortions don’t have them (and don’t be afraid if you’re a christian and have a child out of wedlock, it’s still ok). If you’re so set against other people having abortions offer to care for the mother during pregnancy (foot the medical bills and the support the mother) and adopt the child once it’s born. The fact that you don’t do this tells me you’re not pro-life because you don’t give a shit what happens after the baby is born, you only care that the fetus is carried to term and to hell with anything and everything that gets in the way. What would you do if your daughter decides to have an abortion behind your back and in an unsafe manner because abortions are not legal where you live?</p>
<p>you cling to political power and you forget that you don’t get to take those things when it’s time to go. Whoever dies with the most toys is still dead and, if you so believe, you will be judged by your actions, by how you show your compassion and not just how much money you gave to charity or your church, on how you treated the sick, the elderly and those around you who had real need and not on how you protected yourself when it came to pay more taxes in order for others to be able to afford healthcare.</p>
<p>I guest the biggest questions you should be asking ourselves as christians is this: Are you so afraid of becoming irrelevant that you move heaven and earth to validate our faith at the expense of everything and everyone else? Are you so convinced that you are the one true faith that you’ll destroy all others around us? Are you so afraid of that which is different that you’ll search the bible for portions you can cherry pick to validate our prejudices?</p>
<p>As you spend the last day of a 4-day weekend let’s reflect on what made the United States what it is (or was?). Whatever our differences you are all part of the same country and you should treat each other accordingly. If evangelical protestant christianity doesn’t or can’t see that then I don’t want to be a part of it… it’s just not worth it.</p>
<p>I can’t, in good conscience, be part of a group like evangelical christians. I still believe character matters and I still believe that we’re called to biggeer and better things than what we allow leaders to show. I believe that we’re called to work for the world rather than against it. I believe that any time we grasp political power we loose the kingdom and cause more people to turn away from the christian messagee.</p>
