  <h1>Editor As A PWA</h1>
<p>In 2021 I thought building a text editor based on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor">Monaco</a> and built as an <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> application was a good idea.</p>
<p>Rather than wrap Electron around the app, I will try to build an editor again but make it a PWA.</p>
<p>A PWA presents many of the advantages of a native app without many of the disadvantages.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t require downloads</strong> There is no app store to download from</li>
<li><strong>Updates are automatic</strong> since there is no app store to download from</li>
<li><strong>Installation is optional</strong> you can either run it in your browser or install it on your computer as a standalone app</li>
</ul>
<p>So the goals for the project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate if Monaco is (still) a good editor for a PWA
<ul>
<li>If not then what would make a good alternative?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integrate the following APIs into the process and evaluate how they integrate with Monaco
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.dev/file-system-access/">File System Access API</a> to provide open/save functionality</li>
<li><a href="https://web.dev/async-clipboard/">Async Clipboard API</a> for copy/paste</li>
<li><a href="https://web.dev/file-handling/">File Handling API</a> to let the editor open files of a given type</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integrate a testing framework to the project where it doesn’t exist already</li>
<li>Evaluate if module bundling is still a good idea</li>
<li>Test if ES2017 is still a good target for compilation</li>
<li>Test if there’s a way to make the editor save to remore locations like Dropbox, Google Drive or an S3 bucket?</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the year I will document the process, challenges and learnings from building the project. By the end of the year I hope to have a working prototype of the editor ready for use.</p>
