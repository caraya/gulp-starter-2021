  <h1>Scratch pad</h1>
<p>I also seek to answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is Brave 3x faster than Chrome as it was reported with Brave 1.0?
<ul>
<li>Has anyone repeated the experiment in more recent versions of the browsers?</li>
<li>Are there other empyrical reports of post 1.0 performance testing?</li>
<li>Has anyone updated the tests they run with Brave 1.0?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is Brave faster with Extensions enabled?
<ul>
<li>Will extensions downloaded from the Chrome Web Store work in Brave considering their stance against manifest V3?</li>
<li>Is Brave still faster when you add extensions like Grammarly that inject scripts into the page?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is using a clean profile the best way to test for performance? Isn’t it the case that a working browser will provide different results?</li>
<li>Is Brave faster when a service worker intercept requeststs?
<ul>
<li>How about on second and subsequent visits?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Network impact
<ul>
<li>Does performance change if you use TOR with Brave?</li>
<li>Do VPNs affect browser’s performance?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does building the browsers from source have an impact on performance?</li>
<li>Does automation change the results of performance tests?
<ul>
<li>Is there a statistcally significant difference between manual and automated testing?</li>
<li>Do different tools have different impact on the analysis?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Browsertime reccomends a global install. Does this affect performance as opposed to installing it locally?</li>
<li>Is using Playwright a better option that Selenium Driver?</li>
</ol>
