  <p>Seasons Of Love
Rent Original Broadway Cast / 1996</p>
<p>Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Moments so dear
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
How do you measure, measure a year?</p>
<p>In daylights, in sunsets
In midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles
In laughter, in strife?
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
How do you measure a year in the life?</p>
<p>How about love?
How about love?
How about love?
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love</p>
<p>Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Journeys to plan
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
How do you measure the life
Of a woman or a man?</p>
<p>In truth that she learns
Or in times that he cried
In bridges he burned
Or the way that she dies</p>
<p>It’s time now to sing out
Though the story never ends
Let’s celebrate
Remember a year in the life of friends</p>
<p>Remember the love
Remember the love
Remember the love
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love</p>

<p>[MARK]
There is no future
There is no past</p>
<p>[ROGER]
Thank God this moment’s not the last</p>
<p>[MIMI &amp; ROGER]
There’s only us
There’s only this
Forget regret or life is yours to miss</p>
<p>[ALL]
No other road no other way
No day but today</p>
<p>[WOMEN]
I can’t control
My destiny
I trust my soul
My only goal is just to be</p>
<p>[MEN (Overlapping)]
Will I lose my dignity?
Will someone care?
Will I wake tomorrow
From this nightmare?</p>
<p>[WOMEN]
Without you
The hand gropes
The ear hears
The pulse beats
Life goes on
But I’m gone
'Cause I die
Without you
I die without you
I die without you
I die without you</p>
<p>[MEN (Overlapping)]
There’s only now
There’s only here
Give in to love
Or live in fear
No other path
No other way
No day but today
No day but today
No day but today
No day but today</p>
<p>[ALL]
No day but today</p>
