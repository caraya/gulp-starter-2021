  <h1>The Past</h1>
<p>The 8-man assault team quietly moved into position and signaled that they were ready for the assault.</p>
<p>As they moved into position a strange light began to shine through their bodies. When they began their assault their bodies shone bright with some kind of energy as they phased through the walls to initiate their attack</p>
<p>It was over as soon as it started… The people in the house didn’t know what hit them as the mysterious shapes faded in and out of view moving with inhuman speed and precision</p>
