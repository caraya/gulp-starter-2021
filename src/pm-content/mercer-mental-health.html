  <p>Echoing this sentiment from Twitter</p>
<p>Matthew Mercer
@matthewmercer</p>
<p>On this #WorldMentalHealthDay, know you aren’t alone in your struggles, and that it’s ok to have these challenges. Gods know I have my own daily battles within myself, and am still on the road to figuring out my best plan to living with them. They are a part of me, and that’s ok.</p>
<p>Take time for yourself when you need to, and take solace in knowing how many others are walking a similar path. Find support in your community, and know that these experiences don’t make you the outlier. Do something nice for yourself today. You’ve earned it. &lt;3</p>
