# Revisiting Gutenberg full site editing

Now that WordPress 5.9 is close to release, we can revisit the Gutenberg full site editing experience.

I'm not a fan of full site editing just like I'm not completely sold on Gutenberg as an editor. But, since the market is moving in this direction, I believe that developers should be aware of Gutenberg and the FSE to make clients aware of the differences between the two approaches and provide guidance on the optimal approach to the client's project.

That said I've been reading and researching the latest improvements to the FSE experience and I'm not holding my breath on whether it'll do what I would expect a page builder to do in a portable way.

My biggest pet peeve is that Gutenberg changes the way in which we create themes and that's not necessarily a good thing.

<!-- | Argument | Counter |
| --- | --- |
| Block-based themes will be lightweight and contain fewer files than the current WordPress themes. | Who gets to decide what files are necessary? How will these new non-PHP files affect the template hierarchy? Is the hierarchy even necessary? | There will be no customizer options as they will use the “Global Styling” and other Gutenberg features. | These features are not necessarily more intuitive to use and they will require more time to learn. How do I enqueue custom scripts and fonts for the site? |
| No custom (bloated) header, footer, or blog archive layout builders, as that will be done via the FSE. | How will the FSE be used? How is this experience better than page builders? |
| Minimal theme lock-in. This means you would be able to switch themes more easily than now because you may not be dependant on themes for header, footer, etc. | How so? Do I need to recreate the entire design when moving to a new theme? How do we tell FSE themes that a part of the page is the footer when moving from one theme to another? How much harder will it be to migrate my content from one theme to another? | -->
