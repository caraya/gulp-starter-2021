I've been working my ass off on a project that will not be enough to live off but I'm finding very enjoyable; just took a test before starting the interview process at Tibco; my [Up Work](https://www.upwork.com/ab/find-work/) is now ready for me to start project hunting; I've been listening to an interview with someone who has been very influential in my life over the past 5 years: Tess Vigeland; And, perhaps the most important part, I now longer feel afraid and, deep down, I've come to accept that life is going to be OK.

Tess has been one of my biggest influences (along with [Chris Guillebeau](https://chrisguillebeau.com/), [Sean Ogle](https://www.locationrebel.com/) and [Scott Dinsmore](http://liveyourlegend.net/)) in just saying fuck it to a 9-5 conventional job. As I move to explore other opportunities... Upwork, here I come... I've come across a new interview with Tess Vigeland in [The Broad Experience](http://www.thebroadexperience.com/listen/2017/7/6/episode-109). The podcast itself is [linked here](https://www.acast.com/thebroadexperience/episode109-ambitiononhold).

Just like it did 4 years ago, Tess continues to give me the hope and the courage to just take the leap... where will I land is a different story... and I don't care... it may not be the wonderfully amazing things that I envisioned when I was younger, but it will be amazing in its own way.

And, perhaps, this is the biggest answer to the question of where life is right now... **how do you define success?** and what **would it take to make you happy?**

I missed WDS this year... and I'm probably missing my trip to Europe too but, you know what, it may turn out to be for the best as it may help fund a later, longer, trip  to Asia that has been in the back of my mind for the last few years.

I keep going back to Tess Vigeland's 2013 speech at WDS. Now, as it did then, it helps me to cristalize what it is that I want to do and how I want to get there.

After I talked to my therapist I started turning this thought around my head regarding the conversation that we had: **Does it really matter?** I mean, I can only stay so long with little or no cash flow but that's not the point... the point has more to do with what it would take to make me happy.

I love to travel and I love to explore. So what would be the best circumstances for that to happen?

I would have to get a job that was fully remote so I could work on my own schedule and on my own timing. Those are hard but it's not impossible. Need to follow up with someone about a job that will make it easier to get that flexibility

I would have to find a job in a place where I would like to be long term other than California and where I could get health insurance.

The scariest part is that I may have to consider is to have a full time freelancing career. I'll come back to this later when I talk more about future options.

I would have to explore the possibility of incorporating and getting my insurance as SMB. It probably would be more expensive but it would take away the pressure of knowing where it is that my insurance is coming from. This is ironic because other than 2011 (my posterchild for shitty years) I have never used a lot of my insurance

Ok, so after looking at all these options... at all these possibilities. Why haven't I taken any of these options and explored them to see where they would take me?

> “Why can’t I take some time now and just be? And just explore options, explore the world... what’s wrong with that? Why do we have to constantly have ambition? I don’t agree with that anymore.”
>
> Tess Vigeland

There is a deeper reason for all this. It about how you view and value yourself and how much weight do you put in others' opinions of what  you do and how you do it.

It's taken me a long time to accept this.  It's hard and very humbling to accept that you're afraid of what other people think about you and what you do. It just as hard to learn not to care or, more precisely, to care but push ahead anyway.

> “I really have tried to stop measuring my own value from what other people think...I have come to a place where I’ve stopped feeling bad about not having ambition right now.”

> Tess Vigeland

So the question is, as it's always been, now what?
