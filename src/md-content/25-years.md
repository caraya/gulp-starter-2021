Until I started planning 2019, I hadn't realized how many milestones are ahead this year. Each one of these events changed who I am and what I want out of life.

This March it'll be 25 years since I left Chile to begin the crazy adventure that has brought me to where I am  today. I can't say it's always been easy but it's always been interesting with people who have changed me for the better (I hope).

It's been 21 years since I graduated from Central and moved to California. A lot of things evolved from there, I took the classes I needed at SJSU and finally got my diploma in August.

It's been 15 years since I finished my graduate degree at SJSU. I would have done it sooner but I had an enforced g(thanks old boss) gap between the two halves of my graduate program.

It's been 8 years since I finally said no to the idea of getting a PhD. I still struggle with the idea but do I want to put myself through the grinder for another 4 to 7 years?

To say the past quarter century has been eventful is like saying the sky is blue or the grass green. We take it for granted but it's not all that it appears to be. There are some things that hurt when they happened and they still hurt, when I let them. And, at the same time, I have learned to be in the present. The past is gone and tomorrow hasn't happened yet.

I've learned that the important part is to get back up when you're hurt. Whether physically (I can now laugh about my accident-prone 2011 and the hardware I have in my ankle to remind me) and emotionally&hellip; working on the later one but I think I'm getting better and healthier about it.

I do plan on traveling this year...

One of the things that has scared me from going back to Chile is the fact that I'd be going back as a tourist. My dad is gone (and has been gone for a long time) and I don't think I know anyone well enough (anymore) where I'd be comfortable asking for crash space... I don't doubt that people will offer in a second if I were to ask but I don't know if I'd be comfortable enough accepting.

And then it dawned on me... why not embrace the tourist instead of being afraid of him. Sure, I have a lot of family business to take care of but I can learn and discover the city I didn't know (even if I grew up in)&hellip; and there are so many places that I want to (re)visit again... Neruda Houses, just walk on the beaches I grew up in... people to see and get to know again... so many things that I would love to do with fresh eyes and, who knows, perhaps I can get to know Chile again and put the ghost in the past where they belong...

## The music

The music for this post has fluctuated. Initially I was going to add one song, just what I thought would represent it best. But I couldn't come up with just one
