# Micro front-ends

Over the last few years I've been working at understanding micro front ends, what they are and how they work.

I think I'm finally understanding what micro frontends are, how they work and why they are important for large scale projects. This post is my attempt at documenting my understanding.

## Micro frontends

The idea behind micro front ends is related to microservices. As a project grows, it becomes segmented with different teams building different parts of the project.

It would make the most sense for the team building the feature to also build the frontend and UI for that feature as well.
