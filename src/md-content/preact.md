# I give up, Preact it is

I'm still not a fan of frameworks but I have to accept that, because they are the latest buzzwords and everyone is using them, I need to at least be aware of what they are and what they can do. I've decided to take a look at Preact, explore how it works and research some of the issues I have with frameworks in general, namely accessibility, controlling payload sizes and what happens when JS is not available. 

## How it works?

For this example we'll use [Preact CLI](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli) to build our application

```bash
# once and you're good:
npm i -g preact-cli

# create a new project:
preact create my-great-app
cd my-great-app

# start a live-reload/HMR dev server:
npm start
```


## Accessibility in Responsive Frameworks

## Controlling payload sizes

### React and Webpack

## Do we have a fallback?
