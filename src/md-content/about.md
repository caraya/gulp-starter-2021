# About the publishing project

I first started working with the web in the mid 1990's when I saw it as an easy path to independent study extra credit. But even then I saw the web as an interesting medium.

I've been able to see the evolution of the technologies that make the web into what it has become today (good and bad) and all the awesome things that we can do with it.

I've also had a front seat to some of the biggest debates on and about the web. Floats versus Tables, the WASP call to actually use the technologies we worked creating, Best viewed in IE/Netscape, CSS in JS, Angular versus React versus Vue, and others.

But, at the same time, I've become more interested in the technology itself, how it wors and how to best use it rather than the debates surrounding the technologies. Yes, I have opinions but for the most part I try to keep them out of my writing. I also know I'm not always successful.

There are five main areas I write about:

* How-to tutorials: Geared for the "me-in-six-months" who will want to do something and won't remember how to do it
* Exploring technologies and technology stacks: I'm always interested in new ways to do things and new ideas for how to accomplish tasks that I'm already familiar with
* Thoughts and ideas moving forward: More theoretical pieces about the web, ebooks and publishing and how the intersect with each other and new technologies like AI and Machine learning
* Video and Multimedia: How do new video and multimedia technologies work on the web. This is a product of having worked in video production for distance learning
* Tools for online learning: How can we leverage web technologies for online learning and education

I try to post twice a week on Monday and Wednesday. There might be additional posts when I'm answering specific questions or reacting to specific situations. If I'm reacting to specific issues I will give the person/people I'm reacting to the chance to read it before publication by making the post password protected until a week after publication date.

The idea is that you'll be able to learn from the posts and use the code as needed. I license all my code under MIT but, if you need clarification, ping me on Twitter ([elrond25](https://twitter.com/elrond25)) or via email if you have it.
