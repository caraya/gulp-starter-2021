# Interactive sandboxes gor blogs and training

Working on technical writing and developing training material, it'd be ideal to have a sandbox where you can show code, show the result and provide a way for people to edit it and fork it for their own use.

This post will explore three different options to provide such sandboxes. They are not all the options available but the ones I've explored and what I perceive as they advantages and disadvantges.

## Codepen

<div class="message note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
  <p>I have a pro Codepen account. Some things may be different if you don't have a pro account or if you have a different level of pro account than the one I discuss here.
</div>

Codepen is a combined CSS/Javascript/HTML editor that will display the results in a frame on the same window.
