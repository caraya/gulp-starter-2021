# Fixing width of items in Gutenberg full site editor

One of the things I've struggled with when building my block theme using the full site editor is the width of items in the header and footer.

The header kinda works but the footer doesn't and it's limited to the width of the content.

I attended the [Builder Basics](https://www.meetup.com/wordpress-social-learning/events/284383346) where they discussed Block Layout, Alignment, Dimensions, and Spacing

From the talk I learned that I was doing things wrong.
