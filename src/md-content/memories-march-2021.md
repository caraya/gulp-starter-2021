Today it's a double anniversary of sorts. Today it's 27 years since I left Chile and tomorrow it's 27 years since I arrived to the US... there was an overnight fly in between. 

It's still stamped solid in my mind... the huge immigration center in the Miami airport, thinking that because we made it there at 7am I would be in and out in an hour tops and the hundreds of people who were there ahead of me. How I lost all my connecting flights, how I learned that operators frown when you try to leave a voice mail on a collect call (if anyone remember what those are) and how the guys at the airline were beyond awesome on rebooking my flights so I could make it to Vermont... just not quite the way it was originally scheduled.

It has been one big adventure after another... with amazing people and things that if you had told me in '94 I would have done, I would have laguhed, pat your head and continued moving.

There are a lot of things that I want to do and places I want to see... there are things that I want to do that will reacquaint me with people and places I haven't seen in a long time whether that's 5 years or 30.
