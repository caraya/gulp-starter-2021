# Better docs with Sphinx.js

I've used [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/about-tutorials.html) to document Javascript scripts and portions of larger projects. It's nice and it does a good job but it could do better. In JSDoc we can create tutorials and link to the tutoorials from function description and viceversa.

I've dreamed for a while to have somethingg like [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) from Python-land equivalent in Javascript. Now We have it!

[Sphinx-js](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx-js/) is a Javascript extension to the Sphinx
