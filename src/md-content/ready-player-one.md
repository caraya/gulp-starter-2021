# Is Player One Really Ready?: From Text to Sword Art Online and the dangers in between

<div class="message warning">
  <p>This essay is far less technical than others you can find in this blog. It's a continuation of sorts to <a href="https://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/digital-storytelling-conclusion-are-we-ready-for-the-change/">Digital Storytelling: Conclusion: Are we ready for the change?</a> and it may hit in areas of cyber (online) anthropology and sociology more than the technology itself. It draws a lot on the work of Sherry Turkle and some on the early works from Cyberspace: first steps.</>

We relate to our technology and devices better than we related to people around us. If you have dinner with friends, check how many phones come out of pockets or purses and how much the people around them use their devices. If you're at a conference, particularly a technical conference, check around you and see how many people are actually at the conference, how many are coding or doing other work-related things and how many are just surfing the web or doingg something unrelated to the conference.

The computers and the networks have changed but our desires to isolate ourselves have not.... If nothing else technological tools have facilitated the isolation, even when we're in each other's company

how does this change when
