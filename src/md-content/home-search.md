# If home is where the heart is then where is home?

There are a lot of things that are in my mind right now. I'm angry, I'm afraid and I'm about to (and very tempted to) just say fuck it and start over doing something else somewhere else. I've been particularly troubled by the turn of events in the US (home) and how it has changed things and not necessarily for the better. 

The different components of this post may sound and feel disjointed. I hope to tie them together at the end. 

## on being afraid

My world has never felt so rocky. I'm a Hispanic naturalized citizen with a pre-existing condition. You do the math.
 
In the almost 23 years (it'll be 23 at the end of March) I've been here I don't think I've ever been so uncertain of whether I want to stay or not and where would I go should I choose to leave. 

Despite my position on illegal immigration (I'm deeply against it) the government has called a group of Hispanics murderers and rapists ([context](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/06/16/trump_mexico_not_sending_us_their_best_criminals_drug_dealers_and_rapists_are_crossing_border.html)) and has chosen to build a wall on the border with Mexico "to keep illegal immigrants away". Even if you're not Mexican how does it make you feel? Did trump pick Mexico because of all the seasonal migrant workers that come from there or will he suddenly pick your country as the target of the bullshit coming out of his mouth? 

In addition to this the government has baned entire countries from immigrating to the US based on their religion. They have forbidden people form a country at war (Siria) from taking refuge in our soil. 

They said it wouldn't target green card holders but it did with results that are ghastly to even talk about. What's to stop them from targeting other groups or to start going after naturalized citizens? It is hard but [not impossible](http://immigration.findlaw.com/citizenship/can-your-u-s-citizenship-be-revoked-.html). It doesn't necessarily have to succeed. For me, even the fact that I'm considering it and that I've researched it (even if it was to calm my mom's unfounded fears), means it worked in causing FUD. 

You're probably thinking that I'm overreacting and that it would never happen to a citizen. We weren't expecting it to happen to legal resident aliens either, were we? The truth is that, because this is not a normal government, everything is up in the air and the rules that we took for granted can be easily swept away with one executive order... sure as hell the Republican congress will not lift a finger to countermand Trump's atrocities  

The Affordable Care Act is gone... sooner or later, with or without a replacement. If you're a consultant/contractor with a pre-existing condition you have tough choices to make in the coming months, particularly if you have a pre-existing condition. You will have to decide if having insurance is worth sacrificing the contracting/consulting lifestyle and how much are you willing to compromise to get the safety insurance entails.  

I'm not certain. One way to cheat around this is to incorporate and get insurance through the company but I'm not certain that it's legal and don't want to have to deal with how expensive it is (both incorporation and insurance). 

I feel betrayed in so many levels.
 
To the people who said give Trump a chance... I ask have we given him enough rope to hang himself with? What will be the cost to the people? The cost to the country?

To the people who said that the only important thing was who selected the next justice of the Supreme Court. That should have been Obama's nominee, I dearly pray it's not Trump. 

To the people who still support him. I'm sorry that you feel that way and I wish there was a way to discuss this. But your unwillingness to accept other points of view, your unwillingness to see facts, your unwillingness to see that others may be right kills any desire and possibility for it to happen.  You may be thinking the same way about me... that's your right and your prerogative.
 
To the hypocritical christians who are ok with what's happening because of your lack of action and words against it...

I have stronger words for you but I'll defer them for later.

## thinking about the home I grew up in

My mom's first reaction when Trump won was to want to sell the apartment and move back to Chile. I explained to her gently (or not so gently, can't really remember) that we are no longer Chilean citizens; That we gave it up when we became US citizens and that that was the reason why I held onto my Green Card for as long as I did (took me 8 to 10 years to get my naturalization... I did it some time after 9/11 because of fears that Green Card holders would be deported without question). I further explained that we could go back, that we'd have to have a job and live there for 5 years before we could apply for Chilean citizenship again. 

I hadn't thought about it in a while but recently it has triggered this thought. What do I have here that I wouldn't have if I moved back?

I wouldn't have the support system I've built here. I wouldn't have the freedom and flexibility to travel that I (still) do with a US passport (at least until Trump policies catch up with us and everyone decides to flip the bird to America like we've done to most of them). I would always have to worry about mom, where she is and what's going on with her.
   
Why would I want to move back? I still remember the '99/2000 trip and I remember not recognizing the city I lived in and wanting to come back to the routine of the habitual and to what had, after 6 years, become home. 

The more I think about it the less I want to move back permanently but the more I want to go back and reclaim the Chile that I didn't find back then. I don't know how long it'll take and I don't know when I'll do it but it's an interesting challenge. 

## on being angry and leaving a church home

To my 'christian' friends (at least those who haven't unfriended me or whom I haven't unfriended yet)...

Warning up front... i'm angry and i'm deeply hurt so you may find the language objectionable... so what?

I hope that you're happy with the president you elected (i know not all of you did but enough of you did to give him the presidency) and with all the appalling things that he's done. He has potentially taken away health benefits for over 20 million Americans, some of them your friends, people who go to your same church and who have been in fellowship with you. 

You're right... what's it to you. You're married and can fallback on your spouse's insurance and, if you're single, are healthy enough (no pre-existing conditions for you) that insurance companies will not deny  you coverage without explaining it.

I've also been apalled at hearing some among you say that the most important thing of this election was to secure who chooses the next justice of the Supreme Court. To do that you've put a child in power. A child that has been accused of sexual assault multuple times and who has declared bankruptcy multiple times to not pay debts and who has refused to pay the people who worked for him, including his pollster? You used to care about honesty and integrity, at least that's what you've told the world over and over, you used to care about the character of a president, at least that's what you said in 2008 when Trump and conservative company attacked Obama's birth place and birth certificate, remember? were you lying then or are you lying now?

But that's ok because he'll appoint a conservative justice to SCOTUS to your worldview will continue to be the dominating view for a generation or two. To hell with those who disagree with you and pity the fool who doesn't share your faith and your worldview. We arrogantly title books "Can we be good without God" and then put the lie to the statement with your actions and the disdain you show others.

> Don’t speak to me about your religion; first show it to me in how you treat other people.
> Don't tell me how much you love your God; show me in how much you love all His children.
>
> Don't preach to me your passion for your faith; teach me through your compassion for your neighbors.
>
> In the end, I'm not as interested in what you have to tell or sell as in how you choose to live and give.

> -- Cory Booker

Do unto others as you'd like others to do unto you. For almost a year conservatives in the senate (no doubt pushed by religious conservatives) blocked the appointment of a judge for the supreme court because they were afraid and because they were cowards. They played to the extremes of their constituencies by breaking the law... thinking that when they were in power they would be able to do what they wanted.

Sadly it backfired. It's true that Obama didn't get his pick. Sadly neither will you. Despite shooting themselves on the foot with changing the voting requirement for cabinet members they didn't do the same with nomination to the Supreme Court. McConnell would have to convince 8 senators that a Trump apointee is what's best for the country... good luck with that. That justice should have been Merit Garland... but your party saw it fit to break the spirit of the constitution to suit their (and your) point of view. 

Now let's turn to something that will really sting: abortion. i'm sick and tired of you telling the world how you think they should live. It's far simpler than what you make it sound like: if you don't approve of abortions don't have one and counsel your kids against it... don't tell others what they should do. 

if you consider yourself pro-life why aren't we putting more money into public schools, into assistance for parents who can barely aford the children they have (and please spare me the fucking ridiculous excuse that if they can't afford them they shouldn't be making them, please). This quote sums it up a lot better than I ever could:

> "I do not believe that just because you're opposed to abortion, that that makes you pro-life. In fact, I think in many cases, your morality is deeply lacking if all you want is a child born but not a child fed, not a child educated, not a child housed. And why would I think that you don't? Because you don't want any tax money to go there. That's not pro-life. That's pro-birth. We need a much broader conversation on what the morality of pro-life is."

You think that if a woman is raped she has to carry the child to term and live with what the rapist did to her... heaven forbid that the rapist continues torturing the woman by demanding custody or joint custody... doesn't really matter because the courts are stacked against the woman who was raped, right? But then, of course, she was too easy and deserved to get raped to begin with. 

If it's the life of the mother or the life of the child you prefer the life of the child at any cost. No matter what the doctor says, no matter what the mother says, you only care about your narrow view of the world and use that to define how the world should behave.

Same thing with gay issues. It has never been about biblical values, has it? It's all been about your imposition of your views over others.You use Genesis to justify your position (it was Adam and Even not Adam and Steve), you codemn the modern world as you've become insensitive to the needs and wishes of everyone around you. 

Let me ask you this. What would you do if your son or daughter came out as LGBTQ? Would you still be welcoming and nurturing as you were when your child conformed to your rules and expectations? You claim that it's all about biblical teachings but I'm sure it has more to do with your narrow vision of the 

I'll ask you these questions I first saw in [Sojourners](https://sojo.net/articles/4-moral-questions-facing-modern-christianity) 

1. In the midst of a historically horrible refugee crisis, why didn’t you actively pursue helping the poor, the destitute, and those in desperate need?
2. Why didn’t you recognize and fight systemic racism and inequality?
3. Why were you so supportive of national agendas associated with violence, destruction, and death?
4. Why did you crave martial, economic, and political power when God has already warned you against putting faith in such foolish and temporary things?

The article has interesting verses for you to meditate on. 

I have to say thanks, this whole debacle has made me read the bible, at least the new testament again. I keep looking for all the restrictions you're following and I fail to find them... quite the opposite actually.  

You've probably read the passages below and used them to conform to your narrow view of who is your neighbor, what is an acceptable offering and a long list of additional justifications to make yourselves feel better.

I'm disappointed in the evangelical christian community and how hypocrite we've become. You in your stance against the world and me in my complicity by staying silent.
 

## Revisting: If home is where the heart is then where is home?

I wrote this when I was in Heathrow waiting to come back from my vacation:

>I’ve always loved airports. There is a sense of impermanence and transition. Everyone in here is leaving a place, is in a place and is going to a place. They are not of the place they left, they are not of the place they are in, and they are yet to become of the place they travel to.
