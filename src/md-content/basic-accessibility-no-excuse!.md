# basic accessibility: no excuses

[The WebAIM Million](https://webaim.org/projects/million/) presents a sad report of where the top one million websites on the web from an accessibility perspective. The results are sad.

In the table below, we see the most common accessibility issues and what percentage of the top one million websites exhibit the issue.

| WCAG Failure Type | % of home pages in 2022| % of home pages in 2021 | % of home pages in 2020 | % of home pages in 2019
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low contrast text | 83.9% | 86.4% | 86.3% | 85.3% |
| Missing alternative text for images | 55.4% | 60.6% | 66.0% | 68.0% |
| Empty links | 50.1% | 51.3% | 59.9% | 58.1% |
| Missing form input labels | 46.1% | 54.4% | 53.8% | 52.8% |
| Empty buttons | 27.2% | 26.9% | 28.7% | 25.0% |
| Missing document language | 22.3% | 28.9% | 28.0% | 33.1% |

To me this is appalling. These are not complicated things to fix or automate a solution for.

We'll look at two ways of fixing these problems: manually fixing the issues and using the [Axe browser extension](https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/) from [Deque](https://www.deque.com/).
