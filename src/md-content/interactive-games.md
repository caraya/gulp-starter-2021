I was presented an interesting challenge. Build something like this demo from [profe-de-espanol.de](https://www.profe-de-espanol.de/2018/03/16/un-viaje-por-el-mundo-hispano/)

<div class="video">

</div>

The original was built with [genial.ly](https://genial.ly/) so the challenge becomes how to build soomething equivalent without looking at the original code and making it reusable for areas other than Spanish culture.

## Building the board

Building the board is easy. The original monopoly board is 11 columns and 11 rows
