# Back to the search of sunrise (or a big WTF)

Long stream of conscience ahead

Talking to my therapist the other day made me rethink and reframe things in a way that may not be major but it's certainly interesting.

I think it also helped that the following day was very good mood-wise at the quarantined home of carlos, mom and cat. It really hit me how many things we take for granted and how many things we choose

The quarantine has made me think a lot about changes, stasis and evolution, how they interact and how do you continue to move forward when everything seems to have come to a standstill.

Some of these reflections may sound self-defeatist to people who don't know me or even to myself in a few months. That's ok, as long they don't become an excuse not to do things.

## Back to the beginning again

This Switchfoot song is from Fading West, a movie/album that has an interesting premise: travel, play music, record and album and surf... In essence, work, learn and have fun.

What would be the equivalent for me?

For a while I've dreamed about doing the 4 south american 70.3 races ([Puc√≥n](https://www.ironman.com/im703-pucon), [Bariloche](https://www.ironman.com/im703-bariloche), [Punta del Este](https://www.ironman.com/im703-punta-del-este) and [Florianopolis, Brazil](https://www.ironman.com/im703-florianopolis)) and base out of Santiago to make training and travel easier than base out of anywhere in the US.

So what do you need to really, really make it happen? I mean, beyond getting over your reticence to actually be there? Can I just treat it as a temporary relocation? Should I? I have the advantage that I can get a job there and most of the stuff I want to do is not well known to the point where I can get a job while I'm there.

***I need to commit to get back in shape. The goal is to loose 75 pounds so I can get to a weight I haven't been at since some time after I moved to the US and that is about the ideal weight my doctor says I should be at. Getting that lean would also make my core stronger and you always need that if you're going to do endurance sports like swimming or triathlons***

Is it hard? Hell yeah. Can I do it? We'll find out one way or another.

## Love alone is worth the fight

I love this song but it has a new kind of resonance and gains a new perspective in these times.

How do you define love?  I remember that one of the things I love about Spanish and most other Romance languages is the specificity.

Love is such a generic word but what does it really mean? Spanish has different words to represent the different levels of "love".  So does English but people don't use them and, instead they choose love as the catch all phrase for all sort of attachments.

***I think it's time I start looking after myself.  Yes, you will eventually, hopefully, realistically find someone you want to spend the rest of your life with but you shouldn't let it define the rest of your life. If it happens it happens and if it doesn't then it doesn't.***

## Times like these

One of the things I've struggled with for decades is letting go. Letting go of material things, letting go of people, letting go of attitudes and, letting go of regrets that, intellectually, I know are harmful but emotionally still live with me and have made themselves cozy as hell, letting go of attachment to things and attachments to people.

I think that's one of the reasons why I finally accepted that I may stay single and considering what I'm accepting it may be the best way to be for a while.

***However that doesn't mean you stop looking, it only means taht it's not the driving emphasis of your life. It means that you're careful about who you let in and why you do it.***

***It also means that you don't attach yourself to things, people, places. They were part of your life but, if they are no longer part of it for any reason, then you move on.***

## Please don't ever let me not try

One of the reasons why I told my friend Siu that I didn't want to talk to her anymore was because of the entitlement I sensed in her and the fact that she always seemed to have an excuse ready when challenged to try something that she's not comfortable with.

There is a lot more to it but the post is about me and I don't want to dwell on how little I knew her and what a complete opposite she is to who I'm looking for.

It's upsetting because I see the old me in that, see the difference between my dad and mom when it comes to making decisons and sacrifices and because, sometimes I also fall into the trap of making excuses and weaseling out of things that I know are good for me or that I know I have to do.

***Once I start training I know that XP, my past and future trainer, will keep me accountable and I need that to match the goals I set for myself.***

***But the most important thing is to ask those around me that know me well to keep me accountable for what I say I'm going to do and to kick my ass when I don't do it. Yes, it'll piss me off but I have to be honest in what I choose to say I'm going to do if I decide to go this route.***

## Memories are important but they don't define you

The memories of your life are an important part of who you are but don't define you.

It also speaks about resonances and that's something that has become more and more important to me... the resonances of our friends and loved ones leave in us and how much they affect and change us.

I find this quote from the novelization of Star Trek IV to be really enlightening. This happens towards the end of the movie, right before the tribunal where Kirk is "demoted" back to captain.

> "Dr. McCoy," Spock said, "T'Lar spoke the truth. To the degree that is possible to achieve, we are free, each of the other. But we have our own true memories. We retain resonances of each other. I understand you better, too. Can you accept what has occurred? If you cannot, you will suffer. But it will be your own suffering, not mine. ***If you can take yourself beyond your fear, you will take yourself beyond danger as well."***
