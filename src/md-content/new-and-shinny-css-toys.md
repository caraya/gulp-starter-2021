# New and shinny CSS toys

I was reading web.dev's [State of CSS in 2022](https://web.dev/state-of-css-2022/) made me aware of several new CSS features that are or are about to be available in browsers.

Some of the featues are interesting because of what they do and because they reduce reliance on CSS preprocessors.
