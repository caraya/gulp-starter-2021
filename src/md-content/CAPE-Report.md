# Project Report: Updating Plugins

Most of the plugins have been updated to the latest version. It should be possible to set them to autoupdate automatically but the cPanel WordPress Manager seems to interfere with the built-in autoupdate mechanism.

The PDF Embedder Premium plugin requires a license to update.

## Updating plugins manually

This should be done once a week or once every other week.

The process is as follows:

Log in to WordPress with an administrator account

Click on plugins

Click on Update available (the link on the far right), to the right of `inactive`

Select update from the pull down menu located above the list of plugins

Click Apply
