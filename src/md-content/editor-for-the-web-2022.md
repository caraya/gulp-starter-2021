# Editor for the web (March 2022 update)

I'm still looking for a good toolkit to build an editor around. Most of the solutions I've looked at have some sort of drawback that made me drop them from the project.

Even though it's in beta, [Stylo.js](https://stylojs.com/) may be the best solution I've found so far but I can't create a menu for it so that disaqualifies it from being the solution that we want to use.
