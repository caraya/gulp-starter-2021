# Revisiting streams (again)

I've looked at streams in the context of Node and the browser, but I haven't really done anything with them because I couldn't figure out what the best use for them was.

As I started working with more complex processes, I realized that streams are a great way to handle files without knowing  the size of the file in advance.
