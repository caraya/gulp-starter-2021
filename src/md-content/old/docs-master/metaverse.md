# Introduction

Virtual reality has always held a special place for me. When I first moved to the US in the mid 1990s I got engaged in MUDs and spent a large part of my time (both in and out of college) participating in MUDs andmaking them my research subject for both undergraduate and graduate education.

I've jumped to many virtual worlds. From propietary 2D and Isometric 2.5D worlds, to 3D worlds like Second Life and games (City of Heroes, Eve Online, World Of Warcraft). I still play some of these games and observe the communities that are formed around them.

Reading a review of [Sword Art Online](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sword_Art_Online) made me curious about the series' concept of fully immersive VR, the concept of a VRMMO (Virtual Reality Massively Multi Player Online game), the exploration of some real life issues of immersive virtual realities and whether we're ready for it or not.
