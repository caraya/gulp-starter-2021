# What to do when you're starting to blog
## Or: The advice I wish I had when I started blogging

# Introduction

I've been blogging personally for 9 years and about technical subjects (front end web and digital publishing) for the last 4. I don't claim to be professional but I have learned enough to pass these pearls of wisdom to you as you get started. You don't have to follow them but they'll make your life easier in the long run.

I've broken the content in two areas: 

Plan the flight and flight the plan covers the non technical areas of creating a blog; why do you want to blog? Who is your audience? Building your voice and What do you need to do to get started?

Getting your hands dirty deals with the technical side of creating and working with a blog: Why I chose to work with Wordpress? How do you choose your hosting provider? What options do you have to install Wordpress on your account? How do you create audio and video for your blog? How do we integrate external content. 

It may sound like a lot and I'm not suggesting you have to do all these things when you're getting started with a blog but it's a good idea to consider it when you start and as become more experienced.
