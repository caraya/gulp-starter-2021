# Women in tech, code of conducts and where we all need to change

I've been watching the &quot;Do we need a code of conduct for conferences&quot; issue from the sidelines... the 3 conferences I attend a year (Fluent, HTML5DevConf and Chrome Summit) have a code of conduct and, to be honest, I've had to reevaluate whether attendance still meets my needs as a developer enough to overcome my reservations.

I strongly believe that we shouldn't need codes of conduct to work in a community; That we should know when our actions are detrimental to our community and to those around us in general; That the community should be strong enough to be self policing and that under no circumstance the word of one community member should be taken over another. 

I also understand that there are members of a community that haven't gotten past the ugly combination of kindergarden bullying, sexual immaturity and binge drinking and that level of immaturity leads to actions that are traumatizing for the victims and detrimental to the community. 

Yet I still don't believe that code of conducts are the solution. They are a partial bandaid to stem the flow from a bleeding artery. They are a tiny little step towards a solution, nothing more. 

I've chosen to stay in the periphery of this whole conversation until I saw this on my Twitter feed:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Technologists: how does a Code of Conduct change your willingness to participate in an event/community?&#10;&#10;RT pls? Would love diverse sampling</p>&mdash; Jessica Rose (@jesslynnrose) <a href="https://twitter.com/jesslynnrose/status/639809645985579008">September 4, 2015</a></blockquote>

My first reply was this tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/jesslynnrose">@jesslynnrose</a> Yes, it does... it makes it harder to choose what conferences to attend</p>&mdash; Carlos Araya (@elrond25) <a href="https://twitter.com/elrond25/status/640780500685074433">September 7, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But then I thought about it and I wrote a longer reply below:

> It makes me think about what conferences to attend but maybe not for the reasons you think

> Codes are a necessary evil but in the environment we live now they lend themselves to abuse. 

> Let's say a friend and I are having a private conversation and someone hears us and takes offense to it or suddenly doesn't feel safe.  She reports it to the conference organizers who, depending on the severity, as reported by the person in question, may reprimand me or may even ask me to leave.

> If I stay at the conference where is my comfort level? Anything and everything I say now has to be filtered against the possibility that someone else will be offended or has it against me and wants to screw me over and will report that which they don't agree with.

> The misogyny in tech will not be fixed with conference codes of conduct or people refusing to speak at conferences without them. If we really want to fix the issue we have to work I educating people as early as we can that genders are equal, that who you marry or the color of your skin doesn't matter, we're all still human

It speaks to my fears that we've turned the whole Code of Conduct conversation into another debate over women, technology and the intersection of both.  As someone said in one of the many messages in the thread, a code of conduct will not chage an asshole's attitude (I think the exact words were &quot;an asshole will asshole&quot; as they haven't for the longest time.

So what changed? What made it such an imperative for conferences to have a code of conduct?

[Donglegate](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/a-dongle-joke-that-spiraled-way-out-of-control/) happened. 

The example I used in my longer reply is not farfeteched. It did happen at PyCon 2013 where a woman called men out for a tasteless joke about dongles and forking someone's repo. As bad as the jokes were they were not directed at her, she wasn't part of the conversation, she took their picture without permission and she chose to take them to task in a very public venue (Twitter.) 

The resulting backlash pit everyone in the feminist and politically correct side of the argument in one corner and people who, maybe naively, think we can do better without regulations and, possibly, we can solve issues without violence, without shaming and without a physical outcome in the other. The situation escalated beyond any sane measure... there were DOS attacks against her employer, one of the men making the joke and the woman who accused them were both fired from their jobs and became a sad part of Internet history

I'm in no way trying to demean what women go through... not at all. But in a world that has gone way too "politically correct" we need to be careful in striking a balance between the what we're allowed to say and the sense of safety we should all feel when participating at events. 

We also need to work extra hard at being impartial when someone brings charges against another person. As Donglegate demonstrated it's 

How can I tell that a conversation I'm having with a friend will not offend someone who walks by? How will I know (other than twitter and the big internet or being escorted out by security or conference staff that escort you out of the room you're in or out of the venue altogether before they tell you what reason they have to do so) that I screwed up? Will I learn anything from the experience other than be bitter and resentful against the accuser, against the conference and against the community?

And as women in technology. Will they stop attending conferences? For both the men and women who choose not to attend conferences without Code of Conduct documents: How safe does the document make you? Will it really solve the maturity problems of people who shouldn't have left high school? is this really what we y'all are thinking about?

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I've been tempted to ask this person if s/he has asked why there's no code of conduct for the conferences where one is not present, or are we talking about hypotheticals or whether we just need a reason to bitch at someone and this has become the new battle flag?

Let's also not forget that the same person that expresses outrage in one instance is involved in severaly questionable actions during the same event. While at PyCon 2013, Adria Richards, the same woman that instigated Donglegate tweeted the following:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/skwashd">@skwashd</a> you should put something in your pants next time...like a bunch of socks inside one...large...sock. TSA agent faint</p>&mdash; Adria Richards (@adriarichards) <a href="https://twitter.com/adriarichards/status/312265091791847425">March 14, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Who draws the line? where does the person (or people) draw the line? Should we ask Adria?

We question and criticize the misoginy in the technology world but do we really pay attention to the flip side? Do we pay attention to the radical feminism that attempts to make the world conforms to their wolrd view. It's not enough to fight for equality but we all have to conform to certain women's view of the world.

The situation with Code of Conducts may or may not be the same but the environment to me feels as threatening and toxic now as it did when Adria's situation first became public. So now anyone who overhears me can take action (whatever shape it takes) and get me kicked out of the room, maybe get me kicked out of the venue and, most definitely, damage my reputation in the community. 

There are situations in which this is totally justified; I'm not arguing that point. 

The point I'm arguing is that it's too open ended and too subjective and in a game of she said, he said she gets too much power and something that will not solve the underlying situation that causes all this.
