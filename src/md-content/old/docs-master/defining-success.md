## One big continuum 

One of the things I'm realizing, although I have a hard time accepting it, is that this is not a new event but a continuation. It is not a new stage after Fireeye but a continuation of the same questions I've been asking since I decided to leave and for which, saddly, I don't have the answers.

## Defining success on its own term

I wasn't happy at work and this past few days actually made it worse. I'm starting to question if I came back too early or if I came back to the right type of job. Intellectually I know that I did the right thing but I don't want to be jumping from job to job until I find the one I like (and how will I know if it's the right job and/or the right company if I don't at least try it.) 

I thought it would take me a little longer to be this no-happy. Go back to what made you leave Fireeeye and ask yourself what has really changed. You're still trying to figure out what you want to do when you grow and you're letting that become judgemental passive agressive bullshit

I love the 60 minutes interview with Dave Grohl because it talks about second chances... I didn't know until a few years back that he was Nirvana's drummer, I mosty know him through his success with Foo Fighters.

### So what is success?

Success is one of those tricky propositions like good and bad where the actual definition depends on the person you ask. So rather than ask what is success I think that the question has to be changed to **What is success for me right now?**
