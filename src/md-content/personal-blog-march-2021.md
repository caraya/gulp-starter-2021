# In search of sunrise: Little voices, healing roads and the need to wander

Little Voice
Sara Bareilles

It's everything I am and what I'm not
And all I'm trying to be
This is the part where I spit it all out
And you decide what you think of me
I'm not trying to be complicated
I'm never waiting to get the last laugh
But I've been handing out benefits of the doubt
I'd like a little bit back

It's just a little voice
And if you're listening
Sometimes a little voice
Can say the biggest things
It's just my little voice that I've been missing

Looking over the precious moments
It hurts don't it
They can cut both ways
No amount of remembering the better things
Will make the bad ones go away
But I've been broken and the one to blame
So my savior of self defense taught me to
Sing what I can't say

It's just a little voice
And if you're listening
Sometimes a little voice
Can say the biggest things
It's just my little voice that I've been missing

I will be loud
I'm coming out to tell you words are not enough
I will be loud
I'm coming out to tell you noise is not enough
I will be loud
I'm coming out to tell you words are not enough
I will be loud
I'm coming out to tell you noise is not enough

It's the reason you whisper
You love her alone
We've been handed the mountaintops to sing from
And we still don't
Sometimes a little voice
Can say the biggest things
It's just my little voice
That I've been missing
It's just my little voice
That I've been missing
It's just my little voice that I've been missing
```

***You never let the past drive but you always take him as a passenger.***

Well, around the time I post this it will be 27 years since I left Chile to move to the US, 23 years since I decided I was going to stay here, 17 years since I made it official by becoming a naturalized US citizen

I don't regret the choices that I made to bring me to here/now. But I always question the here/now and wonder if, given the same choices, I'd do anything differently today.

This is tied in with other things I want to do where fear and uncertainty are the keys stoping me (that and the fact that I need to generate money if I'm going to do it).

I want to travel... and that is also part of the problem. My first inclination is Europe and Asia rather than South America and Chile... in a way that's frightening and in another way it's understandable.

In Europe and Asia I don't have to pretend I'm a stranger... I am one. Going back to Chile presents a double fake: I was born there but I have to fake that I'm still comfortable being there and knowing all the cultural norms of a place I haven't lived in for almost 30 years.

But this trip is different... it has to be. One of the things that has eaten me for a while now is what would it be like to live in Chile as an independent adult, something I've never done. I was still living with dad when I left in '94 and I stayed with him when I visited in '99.

Part of the walkabout I want for my 50th birthday is to figure out what it means to live there. Yes, Europe and Asia are more appealing but Chile is necessary.

Depending on how much money I can put away, the plan is something like this:

1. 6 months to a year in Chile. I say 6 months to a year because I don't know if I will be able to take the full year but I want to be optimisitc about it
   * Visit family
   * Travel to places I haven't been to
   * Complete projects I've been thinking about (more on that later)
2. 3 months in Donostia (northern Spain)
   * Do genealogy, one thing I've always been interested in doing for my dad's side of the family
3. Spend time in southern Spain looking for a place to learn Flamenco (if it's possible for me to learn to dance again :))
4. Get a Eurail pass to travel around Europe
   * It saves you hotel money if you choose to fully take advantage of it
5. You can finish the Eurail pass time in the UK and Scotland

It is also important for me to calibrate why I want to do this, not just what I want to do.

By the time I have enough money to do this it will be close to 30 years since I left. The decisions that brought me to here and now are important but is there a reason for me to consider going back? I know mom and I talk about it but I don't think either of us is ready to leave California or the US long term.

Can I become a resident again? How much have things changed and would I be comfortable with the changes on both ends?

In the abstract I get what I gave up when I left and what I've missed since. But I also get how much I've changed... and can only imagine how much have the people there have changed. Is it still an option to live there and get used to the changes in both me and them?

I keep being reminded of Ghost Rider by Neal Peart and the Rush album that came out after he was done with his "travels on the healing road".

I thought I was fine but it's usually around this time and towards the end of the year that I get moody and these kinds of reflections become more common place. I'm also getting closer to 50 now, so it's not a theoretical exercises that would have been like 5 years ago.
