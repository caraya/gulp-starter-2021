  * See [Make the world your playground](cloud.google.com/maps-platform/gaming/) for more information about this part of the API
* What kinds of stories work best for this format?
  * Is it worth retrofitting existing stories?
    * [Rayuela](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayuela_(novela)) or [Hopscotch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopscotch_(Cort%C3%A1zar_novel)) in English
* Combined with location-based games?
  * Look at [The Silent Story](http://www.thesilenthistory.com/) and [The Silent Story: What is this?](http://www.thesilenthistory.com/what)
  * [Inside The Silent History](http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/inside-the-silent-history/) is also a good reference
* If the story is location based how do you make it so it appeals at people in other locations?
  * Like The Silent Story have a secondary thread that happens world wide
  * Make the secondary thread a participatory experience where people contribute and make the story their own
