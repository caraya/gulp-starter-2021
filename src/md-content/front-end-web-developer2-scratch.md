[A Test-Driven JS Assessment](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment) gives you a different way to learn by reversing the learning experience. It consists of a  set of failing tests that cover various JavaScript topics and requires you to you write code to make the tests pass, can you?

One final way to learn is by looking code others have written. **10 things I learned from the jQuery Source** is an oldvideo from Paul Irish that shows what you can learn by reading other people's code. Although it was written for jQuery, a lot of it can be applied outside jQuery and any other framework or library.
