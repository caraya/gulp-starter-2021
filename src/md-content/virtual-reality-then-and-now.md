# Virtual Reality: then and now

I first became interested in virual reality while I was an undergraduate working in an Anthropology independent study project.

That's where I first became interested in online games, online identity, online performance, online identity and other areas of what the internet was at the time.

Over time I've picked a more nuanced approach to these areas of interest and picked others along the way. This essay (or series of essays) seek to put down and, where possible, tie together these areas of interest as well as ask questions for future research.

## Setting the context: Historical record

### Text-based games

### Graphical games

## The more things change: Research and researcher evolution

### How has etnographical work changed?

### Ethical considerations

### Mixing the real and the virtual

### Computers as cultural artifacts

### Relationship to other disciplines

#### Game studies

#### Participatory Culture

## Bibliography
