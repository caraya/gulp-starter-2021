# Locking blocks in the Full Site Editor

## Description

Theme creators can now lock blocks so that editors and authors cannot modify the layout of the block in unexpected ways. In this session weâ€™ll explore the options to lock content in the file editor and how to leverage the locking mechanism when developing themes.

## Objectives

After completing this lesson, participants will be able to:

* Identify the different locking mechanism for WordPress blocks
* Explain the differences between the available locking mechanism and give an example of each locking
* Apply different permissions to locking / unlocking blocks based on user roles

## Prerequisite Skills

Participants will get the most from this lesson if they have familiarity with:

* Completed the Basic WordPress Concepts lesson
* Ability to edit block themes

## Readiness Questions

* Do you want to make changes to your theme?
* Do you need to prevent other developers from making changes to your theme's templates?
* What elements of the selected blocks do you want to lock?

## Materials Needed

* A local install of WordPress
* The TwentyTwentytwo theme installed and active

## Notes for the Presenter

* While we can lock specific blocks in the theme, it should be possible for other developers working on the same theme to undo the locks
* We ask for a specific theme so we can all be on the same page rather than having to figure out what each theme is doing
* This feature is only available in WordPress 6.0 or later or in older versions (5.8 and 5.9) running the Gutenberg plugin. It will not work in version 5.9.x or earlier without Gutenberg
* This is a separate feature from template locking

# Locking blocks in the full site editor

One of the things that I find missing from WordPress is to give theme developers the ability to control what we can and cannot do in the full site editor.

In 6.0, we get a first set of locking features. We can lock individual block and prevent them from being moved or being deleted.

## Why do we need to lock blocks?

There are a few cases where locking blocks is useful.

* We want to keep pieces of content together (movement)
* We need a disclaimer or copyright notice to always be available where we placed it (removal)
* We would like to prevent authors from moving the content of a group individually but only move the group as a unit (both)

## Preparing the content

To start we need to create a few blocks in the template editor in order to have material to work with.

Go into the site editor by clicking the editor (beta) link under the appearance menu

![Location of the full site editor in the Appearance menu](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651791672/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking1/block-locking1.png?_i=AA)

Under the blog header, create a group block. You can click on the block inserter and then search for `group` and then click on the `group` block to insert it into the current template.

![Block inserter searching for a block and preview of group block](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651793971/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking2/block-locking2.png?_i=AA)

Add two paragraph blocks inside the group block. These are the blocks that we'll be working with in the rest of the lesson.

## Locking movement

AS we discussed earlier there might be times when we want to prevent authors from moving blocks individually.

As an example we'll be locking the first paragraph inside the group block we created earlier.

In the full site editor, select the first paragraph block inside the group block and select the options menu on the far right side.

![Options menu for paragraph block showing the Lock option, fifth options from the bottom, highlighted in blue text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651850251/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking3/block-locking3.png?_i=AA)

You will then be presented with a modal dialogue to select your lock option or options:

![Block locking modal dialogue for paragraph block with no options selected](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651878505/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking4/block-locking4.png?_i=AA)

Click the checkbox next to `Disable movement` and click apply.

No one without the required permissions will be able to move the block.

## Locking removal

The other type of locking that is available is preventing removal blocks. This is useful when you want to keep a block in the template but you don't want it to be removed.

In the full site editor, select the second paragraph block inside the group block and select the options menu on the far right side.

When you click the options menu and select the lock menu item, you will presented with the lock dialogue for the paragraph block.

In this case select the checkbox next to the `Prevent removal` option and then click `Apply`.

![Block locking modal dialogue for paragraph block with no options selected](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651853891/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking5/block-locking5.png?_i=AA')

This indicates that we would want other theme developers not to remove the block.

## Locking both

The final locking strategy is to restrict both moving and removal of the target blocks.

There are two ways to lock both options.

The first one is to select the checkboxes next to both options and click `Apply`.

The second option is to click the `Lock all` option and then click `Apply`.

![Block locking modal dialogue for paragraph block with no options selected](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651878500/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking6/block-locking6.png?_i=AA)

## Test the locked blocks

We've covered how to lock block to preveent removal, movement and both of them together.

Now we need to test if the locks we put on the blocks are working.

### Testing movement lock

Go to the theme editor and click on the first paragraph inside the group block we created.

The quickest way to check if we can move a block is to check whether the `lock` icon is visible. If it is visible then the block is locked. We can check what lock was applied by clicking on the lock; this will display the lock dialogue.

![The blue lock icon shows that there is a lock applied to the block](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651963975/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking8_80380433f9e/block-locking8_80380433f9e.png?_i=AA)

When a block is not locked you will see the drag handle and the arrows to move the block up and down

![Unloocked blocks show the drag handle and movement arrows](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651963977/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking10_803806f45e5/block-locking10_803806f45e5.png?_i=AA)

### Testing Removal lock

Testing the `prevent removal` lock is a little more complicated. There is no visible change in the block configuration strip. The way to test if we've successfully locked the block is to check if the remove block (`remove paragraph` for our example) is available in the options menu

![Preventing block removal eliminates the Remove block item at the bottom of the options menu](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfh6ihzvj/images/v1651963978/publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/block-locking7/block-locking7.png?_i=AA)

We need to be extremely careful when we check the lock status of the blocks. We can check if the locks we set are enabled but, at the same time, can disable any locks set up for a given block
