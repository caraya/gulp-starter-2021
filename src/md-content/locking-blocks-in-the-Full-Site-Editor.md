# Locking blocks in the Full Site Editor

## Description

Theme creators can now lock blocks so that editors and authors cannot modify the layout of the block in unexpected ways. In this session weâ€™ll explore the options to lock content in the file editor and how to leverage the locking mechanism when developing themes.

## Objectives

After completing this lesson, participants will be able to:

* Identify the different locking mechanism for WordPress blocks
* Explain the differences between the available locking mechanism and give an example of each locking
* Apply different permissions to locking / unlocking blocks based on user roles

## Prerequisite Skills

Slides (files included in this repo)

## Materials Needed

* A local install of WordPress
* The TwentyTwentytwo theme installed and active
* a non-administrator user to switch to when testing the locking mechanism

## Notes for the Presenter

* It is not possible to lock a block and test that it works with the same account. That's why we ask that participants have a non-administrator user available to test with.
* We ask for a specific theme so we can all be on the same page rather than having to figure out what each theme is doing
* This feature is only available in WordPress 6.0 or in older versions running the Gutenberg plugin. It will not work in version 5.9.x or earlier without Gutenberg
* This is a separate feature from template locking
