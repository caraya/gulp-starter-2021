# Looking at paged media: 2021 edition

I've documented my research on using CSS Paged media for PDF printed output in different posts:

* [CSS paged media](https://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/css-paged-media/)
* [CSS paged media update](https://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/css-paged-media-update/)
* [Revisiting paged media stylesheets for the web](https://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/revisiting-paged-media-stylesheets-for-the-web/)

These stylesheets were designed to work with [PrinceXML](https://www.princexml.com/) and [AntennaHouse](https://www.antennahouse.com/). They are good tools but licensing them for unrestricted use may be pricier than what an open source project can afford. I wrote about them in [Revisiting paged media stylesheets for the web](https://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/revisiting-paged-media-stylesheets-for-the-web/) and about using PrinceXML to generate PDF from Markdown in [Generating HTML and PDF from Markdown](https://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/generating-html-and-pdf-from-markdown/)

[Vivlio Style](https://vivliostyle.org/) seems like an interesting open source, GPL licensed, alternative to commercial libraries. As I suggest for every piece of GPL software, read the license and see if it matches the needs of your project.
