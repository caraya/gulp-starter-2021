# What do I need to learn for front-end development?

One of the hardest things to do in modern web development is to figure out how to put everything together and how not to get fatigued by the sheer amount of technologies and methodologies out there.

I don't intend to be prescriptive but sometimes opinions sound like they are.

## What and how to choose

I got to this "roadmap" from [@javinpaul](https://twitter.com/javinpaul) trough a question asked in Quora. The person asked naively, [Do I need to know everything in the front end road map posted by Hacker Noon website to become a front end developer?](https://www.quora.com/Do-I-need-to-know-everything-in-the-front-end-road-map-posted-by-Hacker-Noon-website-to-become-a-front-end-developer)

Looking at the full roadmap is scary and this is just one part of a three-part document where they will outline everything you should learn or have available to learn if you want to work on the web.

It also troubles me how are items grouped together and what areas are not covered and why.

In later sections we'll discuss some alternative ways to look at what's available in ways that are not as intimidating as they are painted here.

### Starting from the bottom

These are some things that I consider necessary for front-end developers to be familiar with in order to do our jobs efficiently beyond knowing the tools we are required to use

<dl>
  <dt>Git and Github</dt>
  <dd>Github is the most popular Git hosting platform available and it will allow you to do many things other than hosting code. The fact that it is owned by Microsoft has turned a few developers away from Github to comopetitors.</dd>

  <dt>SSH</dt>
  <dd>It allows you to login to another host remotely. This is necessary only if you need direct access to your server's shell to run configurations and modify the server in some way. </dd>

  <dt>HTTP / HTTPS</dt>
  <dd>The HTTP protocol is the backbone of the web. Different developers need different levels of understanding of HTTPS and how they work. We also need too be aware of the </dd>

  <dt>Basic Terminal Usage</dt>
  <dd>Learn how to use the native terminal available to your Macintosh or Linux operating system</dd>
  <dd>Learn how to use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>, an equivalency layer that allows you to run a full Linux Operating system in Windows and run linux binaries from PowerShell and Windows programs from Linux</dd>
</dl>

### Things that are nice to have

<dl>
 <dt>Internationalization</dt>
  <dd>If you are creating global applications which shows information in many different languages across the world then you should have a good knowledge of internationalization. We'll discuss more details of internationalization when we talk about HTML and CSS</dd>

  <dt>Performance</dt>
  <dd>Front-End developers should be conversant with the basics of performance. How does the browser process the content of a page? What resources block and don't block rendering and how to help with performance using non-blocking resources as much as possible</dd>
</dl>

# HTML: The core of the Web

HTML is perhaps the simplest of the three core skills for the web in terms of what we need to know in order to use it.

What is semantic HTML?

# CSS: Making it look pretty

# Javascript: Interactvity or dead weight?

I find the eternal argument of Javascript being required for modern web applications to be unrealistic and dangerous for the web as a platform.

I'm not saying "don't use frameworks at all" but "use frameworks wisely" and optimize them to make sure that your application will work well, no matter what.

# Whatever you choose, use it well
