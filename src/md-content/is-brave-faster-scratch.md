I also seek to answer the following questions:

1. Is Brave 3x faster than Chrome as it was reported with Brave 1.0?
   * Has anyone repeated the experiment in more recent versions of the browsers?
   * Are there other empyrical reports of post 1.0 performance testing?
   * Has anyone updated the tests they run with Brave 1.0?
2. Is Brave faster with Extensions enabled?
   * Will extensions downloaded from the Chrome Web Store work in Brave considering their stance against manifest V3?
   * Is Brave still faster when you add extensions like Grammarly that inject scripts into the page?
3. Is using a clean profile the best way to test for performance? Isn't it the case that a working browser will provide different results?
4. Is Brave faster when a service worker intercept requeststs?
   * How about on second and subsequent visits?
5. Network impact
   * Does performance change if you use TOR with Brave?
   * Do VPNs affect browser's performance?
6. Does building the browsers from source have an impact on performance?
7. Does automation change the results of performance tests?
   * Is there a statistcally significant difference between manual and automated testing?
   * Do different tools have different impact on the analysis?
8. Browsertime reccomends a global install. Does this affect performance as opposed to installing it locally?
9. Is using Playwright a better option that Selenium Driver?
