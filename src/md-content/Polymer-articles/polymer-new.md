# Polymer 2.0 and web components V1

The concept of web components really caught my attention. Expanding native HTML as a way to build applications is really interesting and the Polymer abstractions made it very easy to reason through and the support from the Polymer team and Polymer experts has been top notch. 

I was less than happy when I found out that the transition from 0.5 to Polymer 1.0 would be completely different. Another learning curve but the Polymer team provided an [upgrade guide](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/migration) and [Polyup](http://polymerlabs.github.io/polyup/) to automate the upgrade process. 
 
Polymer 2.0 will be released in early 2017 and, again, it's a completely different syntax that takes advantage of the new V1 syntax for custom elements and shadowDOM and the fact that most browsers have implemented or will soon implement custom elements and shadowDOM. 

This will make it easier to write vanilla custom elements and Polymer elements using an almost identical syntax.  Expect an updated Polyup tool to facilitate the migration. Perhaps the most ingenious idea is the Polymer hybrid mode. You will be able to modify  
  
Polymer 2.0 will also make it easier to create interoperable web components. Other libraries (x-tags, Bosonic and others) are also updating the code to V1 custom elements and shadowDOM so it will become easier to choose what's best of breed rather than what will work with the selected library. 

It's been a while since I last looked at Polymer and Web Components
