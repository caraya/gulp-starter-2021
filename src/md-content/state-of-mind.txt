It's	All	In	the	State	of	Mind
by	Walter	D.	Wintle

If	you	think	you	are	beaten,	you	are,
If	you	think	that	you	dare	not,	you	don't,
If	you'd	like	to	win,	but	you	think	you	can't,
It's	almost	certain	you	won't.
If	you	think	you'll	lose,	you've	lost,
For	out	in	the	world	you'll	find
Success	begins	with	a	fellow's	will—
It's	all	in	the	state	of	mind.

Full	many	a	race	is	lost
ere	even	a	step	is	run,
And	many	a	coward	falls
ere	even	his	work's	begun,
Think	big,	and	your	deeds	will	grow;
Think	small,	and you'll	fall	behind;
Think	that	you	can,	and	you	will—
It's	all	in	the	state	of	mind.

If	you	think	you	are	out-classed,	you	are;
You've	got	to	think	high	to	rise;
You've	got	to	be	sure	of	yourself	before
You	ever	can	win	a	prize,
Life's	battles	don't	always	go
To	the	stronger	or	faster	man;
But	soon	or	late	the	man	who	wins
Is	the	man	who	thinks	he	can.
