# Creating an article dashboard

I've always been interested in how to build an article toolbar to make it easier to interact with the content we make available. Then I saw the toolbar for HBR articles, shown below:

<figure>
<img data-src="images/hbr-article-navigation-bar.png" alt="" width="75%">
<figcaption>Harvard Business Review Article Toolbar</figcaption>
</figure>

Rather than just copy the features from HBR I'm thinking about the following feature set

* View/Download a PDF version of the document
* Increase / decrease the text size

We'll explore each of these ideas in turn

## View/Download a PDF version of the document



## Increase / decrease the text size

## Save the PDF file in Dropbox
