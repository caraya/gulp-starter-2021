Daniel Suarez has written three books that have made me reflect on the role we assign to technology: Daemon, Freedom<sup>tm</sup> and Kill Decision.

Each of these novels present a different and, to me, equally terrifying
It is the last one of the three that presents the most terrifying scenario... authonomous AI with lethal weapons.

 and some of the questions they ask in this area are:

* Will the use of AI systems exacerbate conflict between the individual and society, given the potential benefits and risks of data use? How can these conflicts be mediated or resolved?
* How do important concepts such as data control, consent and ownership relate to the use of AI systems? How can these concepts be operationalized so that they guarantee freedoms for individuals and groups?
* What approaches are needed to fully understand biases in AI systems and data? What strategies should those designing AI systems use to counteract or minimise these effects?
* What forms of transparency are most useful for ensuring the beneficial use of AI? What policies and tools are required to allow for meaningful audits of AI systems and the data they use?

### AI Morality and values

DeepMind's [Ethics and Society group](https://deepmind.com/applied/deepmind-ethics-society/), Google [PAIR (People and AI) research group](https://ai.google/research/teams/brain/pair), many of the [research groups at the MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/research/?filter=groups) address different aspects of the relationship between humans and computers and from different angles. To say that there's no thought and no research being done on AI and it's societal impact is disingenuous.



Part of the discussion involves issues of trust. Is forcing AI agents identify themselves as such the solution?

As developers we may not have a big say in the politics of AI, what gets regulated and how would the regulations be implemented but we can build things in such a way that will better communicate intentions to those people who choose to interact with our AI agents.

We can offer users ways to contact us if they have questions


**Build with a purpose**: Before you start building your bot, you should clearly identify the tasks that your tool will tackle.

**Document all possible flows of conversation**: Unless you are building a super-smart AI assistant, you will need some preset scenarios to start with.

**Decide on the type of interactions**: Aside from the basic types of input, such as voice, text, or both, there are many other ways to interact with a chatbot, depending on its type and purpose. You can use structured messages or quick replies so that users can choose, for example, item size or color from provided options instead of typing.

**Strive for consistency**: The first rule of interface design according to Ben Shneiderman, applies to conversational interfaces as well. Keeping the same voice, wording, input and output formats consistent throughout the conversation helps you create a seamless chatbot UX as well as build a recognizable brand image.

Focus on microcopy
The concept of consistency applies to content as well. For better user experience, keep your messages concise. Using a certain voice, some catchy phrases, or humor in your botâ€™s responses helps you create a unique character which can perfectly personify your brand. This, in turn, will have a positive impact on your brand awareness, making you stand out among your competitors.

Guide your user
Interactions with chatbots can be frustrating for people of a certain age or background. Having proper onboarding and solid user flow helps you engage your users and reduce churn. Provide useful tips and examples on how to use your tool, ask questions, provide tailored suggestions to keep the user engaged and help him/her succeed with your bot.


_____z

Start by designing the entire set of interactions we expect our agent to have. This means sketching all the interactions from what we expect the client to say and how we want the agent to answer.

Document the actions both in the agent (this is what I can assist you with) and outside (agent's website or as part of your entry in a directory)

In addition to the questions and answers you should provide additional information for how to use the agent. These help interactions must be built into the product from the beginning, to make sure users don't think it's an after thought.

Be consistant in your communication.
