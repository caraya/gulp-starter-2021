# is() pseudo class

There are times when we want the same element across the page to do the same. 

The following block styles the `h2` elements inside the `header`, `footer` and `main` elements.

```css
header h2,
main h2,
footer h2 {
  color: red;
}
```

It works but it's error prone, repetitive and may cause all rules to be ignored if there is a mistake.

Published in [Selectors Level 4](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#matches-pseudo), the :is() [pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)takes a selector list, and selects any element that matches any of the selectors in that list. Using `:is()` e can write the previous example like this

```css
:is(header, main, footer) h2 {
  color: red;
}
```

Older browsers support this functionality as :matches(), or through an older, prefixed pseudo-class â€” `:any()`, including older versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. :any() works in exactly the same way as :matches()/:is(), except that it requires vendor prefixes and doesn't support complex selectors.

The specificity of the `:is()` pseudo class is the highest specificity of the `:is()` arguments plus the specificity of the remaining arguments in the selector

For example the specificity for all h2 elements that match the following CSS rule:

```css
:is(#header main footer) h2 {
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

is **1-0-1**. They all take the highest specificity of the attributes for the `:is()` pseudo class plus any remaining attributes for the selector. The highest specificity for the `:is` attributes is the one for `#header` (shown as 1-0-0) and the specificity for `h2` is 0-0-1). This behavior is different than older selectors like `:any()` or `:matches()` where the specificity was calculated differently

For a basic primer on specificity see Estelle Weyl's [CSS Specificity](http://www.standardista.com/css3/css-specificity/) and the [CSS Specifishity Chart](http://www.standardista.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/specificity3.pdf)

Because `:is` is not implemented in all browsers, some browsers require vendor prefixes and some browsers use earlier version of the pseudo class like `:matches`.

```css
/* basic syntax without pseudo classes */
header h2,
main h2,
footer h2 {
  font-weight: 700;
  color: rebeccapurple;
}

/* older webkit */
:-webkit-any(header, main, footer) h2 {
  font-weight: 700;
  color: rebeccapurple;
}

/* older Firefox syntax */
:-moz-any(header, main, footer) h2 {
  font-weight: 700;
  color: rebeccapurple;
}

/* Older syntax using :matches() */
:matches(header, main, footer) h2 {
  font-weight: 700;
  color: rebeccapurple;
}
```

`:is()` and `:where()` accept a [forgiving selector list](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#typedef-forgiving-selector-list).

In CSS when using a selector list, if any of the selectors are invalid then the whole list is deemed invalid. When using :is() or :where() instead of the whole list of selectors being deemed invalid if one fails to parse, the incorrect or unsupported selector will be ignored and the others used.

```css
:is(#header, :unsupported) h2{
  font-weight: 700;
  color: rebeccapurple;
}
```

Will still parse correctly and match supported values, even in browsers which don't support :unsupported, whereas:

```css
#header h2, 
:unsupported h2{
  font-weight: 700;
  color: rebeccapurple;
}
```

Will be completely ignored in browsers that don't support `:unsupported` even if they support the other selectors.
