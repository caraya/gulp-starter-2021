# WebP images in WordPress

## Description

Review what the WebP format is, what impact this might have on website owners, where WebP format works and doesn't (such as OG:Image/link preview). Does WordPress automatically convert the format? Can you upload the format? If this doesn't make it into core, what are plugin options in the interim to use for this?
