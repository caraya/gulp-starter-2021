<h3>[i] Conclusions and Recommendations</h3>

<p>
The Space Task Group in its study of future directions in space,
with recognition of the many achievements culminating in the successful
flight of Apollo 11, views these achievements as only a beginning
to the long-term exploration and use of space by man. We see a
major role for this Nation in proceeding from the initial opening
of this frontier to its exploitation for the benefit of mankind,
and ultimately to the opening of new regions of space to access
by man.
<p>
[ii] We have found increasing interest in the exploitation of
our demonstrated space expertise and technology for the direct
benefit of mankind in such areas as earth resources, communications,
navigation, national security, science and technology, and international
participation. We have concluded that the space program for the
future must include increased emphasis upon space applications.
<p>
We have also found strong and wide-spread personal identification
with the manned flight program, and with the outstanding men who
have participated as astronauts in this program. We have concluded
that a forward-looking space program for the future for this Nation
should include continuation of manned space flight activity. Space
will continue to provide new challenges to satisfy the innate
desire of man to explore the limits of his reach.
<p>
We have surveyed the important national resource of skilled program
managers, scientists, engineers, and workmen who have contributed
so much to the success the space program has enjoyed. This resource
together with industrial capabilities, government, and private
facilities and growing expertise in space operations are the foundation
upon which we can build.
<p>
We have found that this broad foundation has provided us with
a wide variety of new and challenging opportunities from which
to select our future directions. We have concluded that the Nation
should seize these new opportunities, particularly to advance
science and engineering, international relations, and enhance
the prospects for peace.
<p>
We have found questions about national priorities, about the expense
of manned flight operations, about new goals in space which could
be interpreted as a &quot;crash program.&quot; Principal concern
in this area relates to decisions about a manned mission to Mars.
We conclude that NASA has the demonstrated organizational competence
and technology base, by virtue of the Apollo success and other
achievements, to carry out a successful program to land man on
Mars within 15 years. There are a number of precursor activities
necessary before such a mission can be attempted. These activities
can proceed without developments specific to a Manned Mars Mission-but
for optimum benefit should be carried out with the Mars mission
in mind. We conclude that a manned Mars mission should be accepted
as a long-range goal for the space program. Acceptance of this
goal would not give the manned Mars mission overriding priority
relative to other program objectives, since options for decision
on its specific date are inherent in a balanced program. Continuity
of other unmanned exploration and applications efforts during
periods of unusual budget constraints should be supported in all
future plans.
<p>
We believe the Nation's future space program possesses potential
for the following significant returns:
<UL>
<Lem>new operational space applications to improve the quality
of life on Earth.
<Lem>non-provocative enhancement of our national security
<Lem>scientific and technological returns from space investments
of the past decade and expansion of our understanding of the universe.
<Lem>low-cost, flexible, long-lived, highly reliable, operational
space systems with a high degree of commonality and reusability
<Lem>international involvement and participation on a broad basis
</UL>

<p>
[iii] Therefore, we recommend -
<p>
That this Nation accept the basic goal of a balanced manned and
unmanned space program conducted for the benefit of all mankind.
<p>
To achieve this goal, the United States should emphasize the following
program objectives:
<UL>
<Lem>increase utilization of space capabilities for services to
man, through an expanded space applications program
<Lem>enhance the defense posture of the United States and thereby
support the broader objective of peace and security for the world
through a program which exploits space techniques for accomplishment
of military missions
<Lem>increase man's knowledge of the universe by conduct of a continuing
strong program of lunar and planetary exploration, astronomy,
physics, the earth and life sciences
<Lem>develop new systems and technology for space operations with
emphasis upon the critical factors of: (1) commonality, (2) reusability,
and (3) economy, through a program directed initially toward development
of a new space transportation capability and space station modules
which utilize this new capability
<Lem>promote a sense of world community through a program which
provides opportunity for broad international participation and
cooperation
</UL>

<p>
As a focus for the development of new capability, we recommend
the United States accept the long-range option or goal of manned
planetary exploration with a manned Mars mission before the end
of this century as the first target.
<p>
[iv] In proceeding towards this goal, three phases of activities
can be identified:
<UL>
<Lem>initially, activity should concentrate upon the dual theme
of exploitation of existing capability and development of new
capability, maintaining program balance within available resources.
<Lem>second, an operational phase in which new capability and new
systems would be utilized in earth-moon space with groups of men
living and working in this environment for extended periods of
time. Continued exploitation of science and applications would
be emphasized, making greater use of man or man-attendance as
a result of anticipated lowered costs for these operations.
<Lem>finally, manned exploration missions out of earth-moon space,
building upon the experience of the earlier two phases.
</UL>

<p>
Schedule and budgetary implications associated with these three
phases are subject to Presidential choice and decision at this
time with detailed program elements to be determined in a normal
annual budget and program review process. Should it be decided
to develop concurrently the space transportation system and the
modular space station, a rise of annual expenditures to approximately
$6 billion in 1976 is required. A lower level of approximately
$4-5 billion could be met if the space station and the transportation
system were developed in series rather than in parallel.
<p>
For the Department of Defense, the space activities should be
subject to continuing review relative to the Nation's needs for
national security. Such review and decision processes are well
established. However, the planned expansion of the DoD space technology
effort and its documented interest in the Space Transportation
System demands continued authoritative coordination through the
Aeronautics and Astronautics Coordinating Board to assure that
the national interests are met.
<p>
[v] The Space Task Group has had the opportunity to review the
national space program at a particularly significant point in
its evolution. We believe that the new directions we have identified
can be both exciting and rewarding for this Nation. The environment
in which the space program is viewed is a vibrant, changing one
and the new opportunities that tomorrow will bring cannot be predicted
with certainty. Our planning for the future should recognize this
rapidly changing nature of opportunities in space.
<p>
We recommend that the National Aeronautics and Space Council be
utilized as a mechanism for continuing reassessment of the character
and pace of the space program.
<h3>[1] THE POST-APOLLO SPACE PROGRAM: DIRECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE
</h3>

<H4>I.INTRODUCTION</H4>

<p>
With the successful flight of Apollo 11, man took his first step
on a heavenly body beyond his own planet. As we look into the
distant future it seems clear that this is a milestone - a beginning
- and not an end to the exploration and use of space.
<p>
Success of the Apollo program has been the capstone to a series
of significant accomplishments for the United States in space
in a broad spectrum of manned and unmanned exploration missions
and in the application of space techniques for the benefit of
man. In the short span of twelve years man has suddenly opened
an entirely new dimension for his activity.
<p>
In addition, the national space program has made significant contributions
to our national security, has been a political instrument of international
value, has produced new science and technology, and has given
us not only a national pride of accomplishment, but has offered
a challenge and example for other national endeavors.
<p>
The Nation now has the demonstrated capability to move on to new
goals and new achievements in space in all of the areas pioneered
during the decade of the sixties. In each area of space exploration
what seemed impossible yesterday has become today's accomplishment.
Our horizons and our competence have expanded to the point that
we can consider unmanned missions to any region in our solar system;
manned bases in earth orbit, lunar orbit or on the surface of
the Moon; manned missions to Mars; space transportation systems
that carry their payloads into orbit and then return and land
as a conventional jet aircraft; reusable nuclear-powered rockets
for space operations; remotely controlled roving science vehicles
on the Moon or on Mars; and application of space capability to
a variety of services of benefit to man here on earth.
<p>
Our opportunities are great and we have a broad spectrum of choices
available to us. It remains only to chart the course and to set
the pace of progress in this new dimension for man.
<p>
The Space Task Group, established under the chairmanship and direction
of the Vice President (Appendices A and B), has examined the spectrum
of new opportunities available in space, values and benefits from
space activities, casts and resource implications of future options,
and international aspects of the space program. A great wealth
of data has been made available to the Task Group, including reports
from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the
Department of Defense reflecting very extensive planning and review
activities, a detailed report from the President's Science Advisory
Committee, views from [2] members of Congress, the National Academy
of Sciences Space Science Board, and the American Institute of
Aeronautics and Astronautics. In addition, a series of individual
reports from a special group of distinguished citizens who were
asked for their personal recommendations on the future course
of the space program were of considerable value to the Task Group.
This broad range of material was considered and evaluated as part
of the Task Group deliberations. This report presents in summary
form the views of the Space Task Group on the Nation's future
directions in space.
<h3>[3] II. BACKGROUND</h3>

<p>
Twelve years ago, when the first artificial Earth satellite was
placed into orbit, most of the world's population was surprised
and stunned by on achievement so new and foreign to human experience.
Today people of all nations are familiar with satellites, orbits,
the concept of zero `g', manned operations in space, and a host
of other aspects characteristic of this new age - the age of space
exploration.
<p>
The United States has carried out a diversified program during
these early years in space, requiring innovation in many fields
of science, technology, and the human and social sciences. The
Nation's effort has been interdisciplinary, drawing successfully
upon a synergistic combination of human knowledge, management
experience, and production know-how to bring this National to
a position of leadership in space.
<p>
Space activities have become a part of our national agenda.
<p>
We now have the benefit of twelve years of space activity and
our leadership position as background for our examination of future
directions in space.
<H4>National Priorities</H4>

<p>
By its very nature, the exploration and exploitation of space
is a costly undertaking and must compete for funds with other
national or individual enterprises. Now that the national goal
of manned lunar landing has been achieved, discussion of future
space goals has produced increasing pressures for reexamination
of, and possible changes in, our national priorities.
<p>
Many believe that funds spent for the space program contribute
less to our national economic growth and social well-being than
funds allocated for other programs such as health, education urban
affairs, or revenue sharing. Others believe that funds spent for
space exploration will ultimately return great economic and social
benefits not now foreseen. These divergent views will persist
and must be recognized in making decisions on future space activities.
<p>
The Space Task Group has not attempted to reconcile these differences.
Neither have we attempted to classify the space program in a heirarchy
of national priorities. The Space Task Group has identified major
technical and scientific challenges in space in the belief that
returns will accrue to the society that takes up those challenges.
<H4>Values and Benefits</H4>

<p>
The magnitude of predicted great economic and social benefits
from space activities cannot be precisely determined. Nevertheless,
there should be a recognition that significant direct benefits
have been realized as a result of space investments, particularly
from applications programs, as a long-term result of space science
activities, DOD space activities, and advancing technology. These
direct benefits are only part of the total set of benefits from
the space program, many of which are very difficult to quantify
and therefore are not often given adequate consideration when
costs and benefits from space activities are weighed or assessed
in relation to other national programs.
<p>
[4] Benefits accrue in each of the following areas:
<UL>
<Lem>economic - directly through applications of space systems
to services for man, and indirectly through potential for increased
productivity resulting from advancing technology; improvements
in reliability, quality control techniques, application of solid
state electronics, and computer technology resulting from demands
of space systems; advances in understanding and use of exotic
new materials and devices with broad applicability; refinement
of systems engineering and management techniques for extremely
complex developments.
<Lem>national security - directly through DOD space activities,
and indirectly through enhancement of the national spirit and
self-esteem; reinforcement of the image of the United States as
a leader in advanced technology; strengthening of our international
posture through demonstration that a free and democratic society
can achieve a challenging, technologically sophisticated, long-term
objective; maintenance of a broad base of highly skilled aerospace
workers applicable to defense needs; and advancement of technology
that may have relevance to defense use.
<Lem>science - directly through support for ground and space research
programs, indirectly through ability to open to observation new
portions of the electromagnetic spectrum; opportunity to search
for life on other planets, to make measurements in situ at the
planets or in other regions of space, and to utilize the unique
environment of space (high vacuum, zero 'g') for experimental
programs in the life sciences, physical sciences and engineering.
<Lem>exploration - the opening of new opportunities to investigate
and acquire knowledge about man's environment - which now has
expanded to include not only the Earth, but potentially the entire
solar system.
<Lem>social - providing educational services through enhanced communications
which improved treatment of social problems.
<Lem>international relations - providing opportunities for cooperation;
the identification of foreign interests with U.S. space objectives
and programs, and their results.
</UL>

<p>
What is the value to be placed upon these benefits, and how should
the space program be constituted to provide the greatest return
in each of these areas for a selected level of public investment?
<p>
The answers to these questions cannot be stated in absolute terms
- there is no dollar value associated with national self-esteem
or with many of the other benefits listed above, and there is
no fixed program of missions without which these benefits will
not accrue. As with many programs, there is, however, a lower
limit of activity below which the viability of the program is
threatened and a reasonable upper limit which is imposed by technological
capability and rate of growth of the program.
<p>
These limits are a key consideration in the options discussed
later in this report.
<p>
[5]
<H4>National Resource</H4>

<p>
In the eleven years since its creation, NASA has provided the
Nation with a broad capability for a wide variety of space activity,
and has successfully completed a series of challenging tasks culminating
in the first manned lunar landing. These accomplishments have
involved rapid increases to peak annual expenditures of almost
$6 billion and a peak civil service and contractor work force
of 420,000 people. Expenditures for NASA have subsequently dropped
over the last three years from this peak to the present level
of about $4 billion and supporting manpower has dropped to about
190,000 people.
<p>
In addition to NASA space activity, the DOD has developed and
operated space systems satisfying unique military requirements.
Spending for military space grew rapidly in the early sixties
and has increased gradually during the past few years to approximately
$2 billion per year.
<p>
The Nation's space program has fostered the growth of a valuable
reservoir of highly trained, competent engineers, managers, skilled
workmen and scientists within government, industry and universities.
The climactic achievenment of Apollo 11 is tribute to their capability.
<p>
This resource together with supporting facilities, technology
and organizational entities capable of complex management tasks
grew and matured during the 1960's largely in response to the
stimulation of Apollo, and if it is to be maintained, needs a
new focus for its future.
<H4>Manned Space Flight</H4>

<p>
There has been universal personal identification with the astronauts
and a high degree of interest in manned space activities which
reached a peak both nationally and internationally with Apollo.
The manned flight program permits vicarious participation by the
man-in-the-street in exciting, challenging, and dangerous activity.
Sustained high interest, judged in the light of current experience,
however, is related to availability of new tasks and new mission
activity - new challenges for man in space. The presence of man
in space, in addition to its effect upon public interest in space
activity, can also contribute to mission success by enabling man
to exercise his unique capabilities, and thereby enhance mission
reliability, flexibility, ability to react to unpredicted conditions,
and potential for exploration.
<p>
While accomplishments related to man in space have prompted the
greatest acclaim for our Nation's space activities, there has
been increasing public reaction over the large investments required
to conduct the manned flight program. Scientists have been particularly
vocal about these high costs and problems encountered in performing
science experiments as part of Apollo, a highly engineering oriented
program in its early phases.
<p>
Much of the negative reaction to manned space flight, therefore,
will diminish if costs for placing and maintaining man in space
are reduced and opportunities for challenging new missions with
greater emphasis upon science return are provided.
<p>
[6]
<H4>Science and Applications</H4>

<p>
Although high public interest has resided with manned space flight,
the Nation has also enjoyed a successful and highly productive
science and applications program.
<p>
The list of more achievements in space science is great, ranging
from our first exploratory orbital flights resulting in discoveries
about the Earth and its environment to the most recent Mariner
missions to the vicinity of Mars producing new data about our
neighbor planet.
<p>
Both optical and radio astronomy have been stimulated by the opening
of new regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and new fields
of interest have been uncovered - notably in the high energy X-ray
and gamma-ray regions. Astronomy is advancing rapidly at present,
partly with the aid of observations from space, and a deeper understanding
of the nature and structure of the universe is emerging. In planetary
exploration, we have a unique opportunity to pursue a number of
the major questions man has asked about his relation to the universe.
What is the history of the formation and evolution of the solar
system? Are there clues to the origin of life? Does life exist
elsewhere in the solar system?
<p>
In the life sciences, questions about the effect of zero 'g' upon
living systems, demands of long-duration space flight upon our
understanding of man and his interaction or response to his environment,
both physiologically and psychologically, promise new insights
into the understanding of complex living systems.
<p>
These are only a few of the disciplines that have profited from
the program of research in space. Space science is not divorced
from science on the ground, but is rather an extension of science
which builds and depends vitally upon a strong ground-based foundation.
<p>
Building upon the basic science on the ground and in space, and
upon the growing capability in the design, construction and launch
of satellites, the United States pioneered in the development
of space applications - notably communications, meteorology and
navigation. Operational systems have been placed into service
in each of these areas, and the potential for the future appears
bright - not only in these areas but also in new fields such as
earth resource surveying and oceanography.
<H4>International Aspects</H4>

<p>
Achievement of the Apollo goal resulted in a new feeling of &quot;oneness&quot;
among men everywhere. It inspired a common sense of victory that
can provide the basis for new initiatives for international cooperation.
<p>
The U.S. and the USSR have widely been portrayed as in a &quot;race
to the Moon&quot; or as vying over leadership in space. In a sense,
this has been on accurate reflection of one of the several strong
motivations for U.S. space program decisions over the previous
decade.
<p>
[7] Now with the successes of Apollo, of the Mariner 6 and 7 Mars
flybys, of communications and meteorology applicotions, the U.S.
is at the peak of its prestige and accomplishments in space. For
the short term, the race with the Soviets has been won. In reaching
our present posirion, one of the grear strengths of the U.S. space
program has been its open nature, and the broad front of solid
achievement in science and applications that has accompanied the
highly successful manned flight program.
<p>
The attitude of the American people has gradually been changing
and public frustration over Soviet accomplishments in space, an
important force in support of the Nation's acceptance of the lunar
landing in 1961, is not now present. Today, new Soviet achievements
are not likely to have the effect of those in the post. Nevertheless,
the Soviets have continued development of capability for future
achievements and dramatic missions of high political impact are
possible. There is no sign of retrenchment or withdrawal by the
Soviets from the public arena of space activity despite launch
vehicle and spacecraft failures and the preemptive effect of Apollo
11.
<p>
The landing on the Moon has captured the imagination of the world.
It is now abundantly clear to the man in the street, as well as
to the political leaders of the world, that mankind now has at
his service a new technological capability, an important characteristic
of which is that its applicability transcends national boundaries.
If we retain the identification of the world with our space program,
we have on opportunity for significant political effects on nations
and peoples and on their relationships to each other, which in
the long run may be quite profound.
<h3>[9] Ill. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</h3>

<H4>Goals</H4>

<p>
An important aspect in both popular acceptance of the space program
and in the spirit, dedication and performance of those who ore
directly involved in space activity is the conviction that such
activity is worthwhile and contributes to the quality of life
on Earth.
<p>
Public support for the space program con be related to understanding
of the values derived from space activity and to understanding
and acceptance of long-term goals and objectives which establish
the framework for the program.
<p>
In the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, the Congress
declared &quot;...it is the policy of the United States that activities
in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit
of all mankind.&quot; This policy statement, which served effectively
as a guide to the first decade in space, must now be translated
into clearly enuncioted new long-range goals and program objectives
for the post-Apollo space program.
<p>
We view the challenge of setting new goals, of providing a focus
for our future space activities, of expanding the limits of man's
reach and thereby demonstrating America's leadership in scientific
and technological undertakings while maintaining the confidence
of the people in the strength and purpose of our Nation, as the
key to continued space leadership by the United States.
<p>
Facing this challenge, some would urge that our efforts should
be restricted to exploitation of existing capability, pointing
out, quite correctly, that exciting and challenging missions remain
to be accomplished which con utilize the existing base. But such
a course would risk loss of the foundation for future achievements
- a foundation which depends largely on providing a new capability
which challenges our technology.
<p>
One of the values of the lunar landing goal was that it carried
a definite time for its accomplishment, which stressed our technology
and served as basis for planning and for budget support. It was
a national commitment, a demonstration of the will and determination
of the American people and of our technological competence at
a time when these attributes were being questioned by many.
<p>
The need for an expression of our strength and determination as
a Nation has changed considerably since that time. Today the need
is for guidance - for direction - to set before the people a vision
of where we are going.
<p>
[10] Such a vision for the future should have a number of important
qualities:
<UL>
<Lem>it should have substantive values that are easily characterized
and understood
<Lem>it should have a long-term goal, a beacon, an aim for our
activities to act as a guide to both short-term and longer range
decisions
<Lem>it should be sufficiently long-range to ensure that adequate
opportunity exists for solid progress in a step-by-step fashion
towards that long-term goal yet sufficiently within reach that
each step draws measurably closer to that goal
<Lem>it should be challenging both for man's spirit of adventure
and of exploration and for man's technological capability
<Lem>it should foster the simultaneous utilization of space capabilities
for the welfare, security, and enlightenment of all people.
</UL>

<p>
The Space Task Group has concluded that a balanced space program
that exploits the great potential for automated and remotely-controlled
spacecraft and at the some time maintains a vigorous manned flight
program, can provide such a vision.
<p>
This balanced program would be based upon a framework in which
the United States would:
<UL>
<Lem>Accept, for the long term, the challenge of exploring the
solar system, using both manned and unmanned expeditions.
<Lem>Develop on integrated and efficient space capability that
will make Earth-Moon space easily and economically accessible
for manned and unmanned systems.
<Lem>Maintain a steady return on space investments in applications,
science, and technology.
<Lem>Use our space capability not only to extend the benefits of
space to the rest of the world, but also to increase direct participation
by the world community in both manned and unmanned exploration
and use of space.
</UL>

<p>
The balanced program for the future envisioned by the Task Group
would possess several important characteristics:
<UL>
<Lem>flexibility. The ability to see clearly the opportunities
that lie ahead in this new field is limited at best. Some opportunities
will fade as we approach them while others, not even discernible
at this time, will blossom to the first magnitude. This program
will permit the course and time scale to be flexible, to adjust
to variations in funding, to shifting national and international
conditions, while preserving a guidepost for the future.
<Lem>challenge. The space program has flourished under a set of
goals that has demanded the highest standards of performance,
and an incentive for excellence that has become characteristic
of our space efforts. A balanced program of both challenging near-term
objectives and long-range goals will enhance and preserve these
attributes in the future.
<Lem>[11] opportunity. The Nation has in being significant capability
for space activity. Abundant opportunities exist for further exploitation
of this capability. A balanced progrom will permit adequate attention
to applications and science while also creating new opportunities
through development of new capability.
</UL>

<p>
In its deliberations, the Space Task Group considerd a number
of challenging new mission goals which were judged both technically
feasible and achievable within a reasonable time, including establishment
of a lunar orbit or surface base, a large 50-lOO man earth-orbiting
space base, and manned exploration of the planets. The Space Task
Group believes that manned exploration of the planets is the most
challenging and most comprehensive of the many long-range goals
available to the Nation at this time, with manned exploration
of Mars as the next step toward this goal. Manned planetary exploration
would be a goal, not an immediate program commitment; it would
constitute on understanding that within the context of a balanced
space program, we will plan and move forward as a Nation towards
the objective of a manned Mars landing before the end of this
century. Mars is chosen because it is most earth-like, is in fairly
close proximity to the Earth, and has the highest probability
of supporting extraterrestrial life of all of the other planets
in the solar system.
<p>
What are the implications of accepting this long-range goal or
option on the character of the space program in the immediate
future?
<p>
In a technical sense, the selection of manned exploration of the
planets as a long-term option for the United States space program
would act to focus a wide range of precursor activities and would
be reflected in many decisions, large and small, where potential
future applicability to long-lived manned planetary systems design
will have relevance. In a broader sense such a selection would
tend to reinforce and reaffirm the basic commitment to a long-term
continued leadership position by the United States in space.
<p>
The Space Task Group sees acceptance of the long-term goal of
manned planetary exploration as an important part of the future
agenda for this Nation in space. The time for decisions an the
development of equipment peculiar to manned mission to Mars will
depend upon the level of support, in a budget sense, that is committed
to the space program.
<p>
NASA has outlined plans that would include a manned Mars mission
in 1981 with the development decision on a Mars Excursion Module
in FY 1974, if the Nation were to accept this commitment. Such
a program would result in maximum stimulation of our technology
and creation of new capability. There are many precursor activities
that will be required before a manned Mars mission is attempted,
such as detailed study of biomedical aspects, both physiological
and psychological, of flights lasting 500-600 days, unmanned reconnaissance
of the planets, creation of highly reliable life support systems,
power supplies, and propulsion capability adequate for the rigors
of such a voyage and reliable enough to support man. Decision
to proceed with a 1981 mission would require early attention to
these precursor activities.
<p>
While launch of a manned Mars exploration mission appears achievable
as early as 1981, it can also be accomplished at any one of the
roughly biennial launch opportunities following this date, provided
essential precursor activities have been carried out.
<p>
[12] Thus, the understanding that we are ultimately going to explore
the planets with man provides a shaping function for the post-Apollo
space program. However, in a balanced program containing other
goals and objectives, this focus should not assume over-riding
priority and cause sacrifice of other important activity in times
of severe budget constraints. Flexibility in program content and
options for decision on the specific date for a manned Mars mission
are inherent in this understanding.
<p>
The Space Task Group, in response to the President's request for
a &quot;Coordinated program and budget proposal,&quot; has therefore
chosen this balanced program as that plan best calculated to meet
the Nation's needs for direction of its future space activity.
In reaching this conclusion we have considered international and
domestic influences, weighed and placed in perspective science
and engineering development, exploration and application of space,
manned and unmanned approaches to space missions, and have appraised
interagency influences. Discussion of the principal objectives
which describe this balanced program follows.
<H4>Program Objectives</H4>

<p>
Elements of the balanced program recommended by the Space Task
Group can be identified within the following set of program objectives
which define major emphases for future space activity:
<UL>
<Lem>Application of space technology to the direct benefit of mankind
<Lem>Operation of military space systems to enhance national defense
<Lem>Exploration of the solar system and beyond
<Lem>Development of new capabilities for operating in space
<Lem>International participation and cooperation
</UL>

<p>
1. Application of space technology to the direct benefit of mankind.
<p>
Focus: To increase utilization of space capabilities for services
to man. Programs directed toward the application of the Nation's
space capabilities to a wide range of services, such as air and
ocean traffic control, world-wide navigation systems, environmental
monitoring and prediction (weather, pollution), earth resource
survey (crops, water resources, geological structures, oceanography)
and communications have great potential for improving the quality
of life on this planet Earth. Significant direct economic and
social benefits from such applications have been forecast. Major
contributions to management of domestic problems and greater opportunities
for international cooperation could result from an expanded space
applications program.
<p>
2. Operation of military space systems to enhance national defense
<p>
Focus: Enhance the defense posture of the United States and thereby
support the broader objective of peace and security for the world.
<p>
[13] The Department of Defense is presently using space capabilities
in the support of communications, weather forecasting, navigation,
surveillance and mapping, and for other functions. Such space
activity has been not an end in itself, but a means for accomplishing
functions in support of existing forces and missions. Military
uses of space have proven effective and space systems are now
contenders for specific applications and missions. Each military
space mission should continue to be decided on a case-by-case
basis in competition with ground, sea, and airborne systems and
should reflect priority given to national defense with consideration
of arms limitation agreements, and other U. S. policy reactions.
Exploitation of the unique characteristics of space systems by
the Department of Defense can provide increased confidence in
the ability of this Nation to defend itself from any aggressor
and assurance that space will be used for peaceful purposes by
all nations.
<p>
3. Exploration of the solar system and beyond.
<p>
Focus: Increase man's knowledge of the universe.
<p>
Exploration of the solar system and observations beyond the solar
system should be important continuing broad objectives of the
Nation's space program. Many unanswered scientific questions remain
about the planets, the interplanetary medium, the sun - both as
a type of star and as a source of the earth's energy - and about
a variety of celestial objects, such as pulsars, quasars, X-ray
and gamma ray sources. Both ground-and space-based experiments
and observational programs will contribute to the quest for answers
to these questions. Space platforms provide several unique advantages
- such as ability to observe across the range of wave lengths
of the electromagnetic spectrum (rather than only through specific
atmospheric &quot;windows,&quot; which is the case from the ground);
freedom from local environmental conditions; potential for continuous
observations (no day-night cycle); ability to approach, orbit
and land on extraterrestrial bodies - and also disadvantages -
high cost, inaccessibility for easy repair and servicing, and
long lead times for experiment modification. For these reasons
a careful balance between investments in space and ground experiments
should be maintained.
<p>
The major elements of such a program should be:
<p>
Planetary Exploration - Unmanned planetary exploration missions
continuing throughout the decade, both for science returns and,
in the case of Mars and Venus, as precursors to later manned missions.
The program should include progressively more sophisticated missions
to the near planets as well as multiple-planet flyby missions
to the outer planets taking advantage of the favorable relative
positions of the outer planets in the late 1970's. Early missions
to the asteroid belt and to the vicinity of a comet should be
planned.
<p>
Astronomy, Physics, the Earth and Life Sciences - In each of these
disciplines, extension of existing or planned unmanned programs
promises continued high science return. There are additional significant
opportunities for experiments in connection with manned Earth
orbital programs which should be exploited. Work in astronomy,
physics and the life sciences, as well as work in the earth sciences
and remote sensing, will form an essential part of the foundation
for future applications benefits and will contribute to the broadening
horizons of man as he acquires knowledge not only of his own planet
but also about the rest of the universe.
<p>
[14] Lunar Exploration - Apollo-type manned missions to continue
exploration of the Moon should proceed. The launch rate should
permit maximum responsiveness to new discoveries while maintaining
mission safety and efficient utilization of support personnel.
Early upgrading of lunar exploration capability beyond the basic
Apollo level including enhanced mobility capability, and lunar
rovers, is important to safe and efficient realization of significant
returns over the longer term. An orbiting lunar station, followed
by a surface-base, building upon Earth orbital space station and
space transportation system developments, could be deployed as
early as the latter half of the decade. Extension of manned lunar
activity beyond upgraded Apollo capability should include consideration
of these options.
<p>
4. Development of new capabilities for operating in space.
<p>
Focus: Develop new systems for space operations with emphasis
upon the critical factors of: commonality, (2) reusability, and
(3) economy.
<p>
Exploration and exploitation of space is costly with our current
generation of expendable launch vehicles and spacecraft systems.
This is particularly true for the manned flight program. Recovery
and launch costs will become on even more significant factor when
multiple re-visit and resupply missions to on Earth orbiting space
station are contemplated. Future developments should emphasize:
<p>
Commonality - the use of a few major systems for a wide variety
of missions.
<p>
Reusability - the use of the same system over a long period for
a number of missions.
<p>
Economy - far example, the reduction in the number of &quot;throw
away&quot; elements in any mission; the reduction in the number
of new developments required; the development of new program principles
that capitalize on such capabilities as man-tending of space facilities;
and the commitment to simplification of space hardware.
<p>
An integrated set of major new elements which satisfy these criteria
are:
<p>
a. A space station module that would be the basic element of future
manned activities in Earth orbit, of continued manned exploration
of the Moon, and of manned expeditions to the planets. The space
station will be a permanent structure, operating continuously
to support 6-12 occupants who could be replaced at regular intervals.
Initially, the space station would be in a low altitude, inclined
orbit; later stations would be established in polar and synchronous
orbits. The same space station module would also provide a permanent
manned station in lunar orbit from which expeditions could be
sent to the surface.
<p>
By joining together space station modules, a space base could
be created. Occupied by 50-lOO men, this base would be a laboratory
in space where a broad range of physical and biological experiments
would be performed.
<p>
Finally, the space station module would be the prototype of a
mission module for manned expeditions to the planets.
<p>
[15] Such an array of space station modules would be designed
to utilize the space transportation system described below.
<p>
b. A space transportation system that will:
<p>
Provide a major improvement over the present way of doing business
in terms of cost and operational capability.
<p>
Carry passengers, supplies, rocket fuel, other spacecraft, equipment,
or additional rocket stages to and from orbit on a routine aircraft-like
basis.
<p>
Be directed toward supporting a spectrum of both DoD and NASA
missions.
<p>
Although the concept of such a space transportation capability
is not new, advances in rocket engine technology, additional experience
in design for reentry conditions, and improved guidance, navigation
and automated check-out systems now permit initiation of on experimental
effort for a Space Transportation System with technical, operational,
and economic characteristics satisfying the needs of both NASA
and DoD. An orderly, phased, step-by-step development program
could then be implemented including as potential components:
<p>
A reusable chemically fueled shuttle operating between the surface
of the Earth and low-earth orbit in an airline-type mode.
<p>
A chemically fueled reusable space tug or vehicle for moving men
and equipment to different earth orbits. This some tug could also
be used as a transfer vehicle between the lunar-orbit base and
the lunar surface.
<p>
A reusable nuclear stage far transporting men, spacecraft and
supplies between Earth orbit and lunar orbit and between low Earth
orbit and geosynchronous orbit and for other deep space activities.
The NERVA nuclear engine development program, presently underway
and included in all of the options discussed later, provides the
basis for this stage and represents a major advance in propulsion
capability.
<p>
c. Advanced Technology Development - In addition to the major
vehicle developments listed above, a continuing program of investigation
and exploration of new technology that can serve as the foundation
for next generation systems is on essential component of the DoD,
NASA, and other agency programs. A broad and aggressive program
to advance our capabilities to operate in space during the next
decade and to set the stage for the decade to follow is needed.
<p>
We foresee future requirements for larger and more efficient power
supplies utilizing a range of energy sources, particularly nuclear
systems, for continuing propulsion system improvements - both
in performance and reliability, for improved understanding of
the complex interface between man and machine, for advances in
technology and systems design that result in lower cost development
of new spacecraft, and for achievement of new levels of reliability.
In the advanced technology program, we should emphasize biomedical
research, space power and propulsion technology, both nuclear
and non-nuclear, remotely control led teleoperators, data management,
multi-spectral sensors, communication and navigation technology,
and experimental evaluation and demonstration of new concepts.
<p>
[5] 5. International participation and cooperation.
<p>
Focus: To promote a sense of world community; to optimize international
scientific, technical, and economic participation; to apply space
technology to mankind's needs; and to shore the benefit and cost
of space research and exploration.
<p>
To these ends, our international interests will be served best
by (1) projects which afford maximum opportunities for direct
foreign participation, (2) projects which yield economic and social
benefits for other countries as well as ourselves, and (3) activities
in which further international agreement and coordination might
usefully be employed.
<p>
The post decade has demonstrated that programs like Project Apollo
are virtually unrivaled in their capacity to catch the world's
imagination and interest, win extensive admiration and respect
for American achievements, and generate a common human experience.
The decade has demonstrated also that effective ways can be found
to share the practical benefits of space with people everywhere,
as in space meteorology and communications. Modest but significant
levels of direct participation in space flight research and exploration
have also been successfully achieved through cooperative projects.
Future program plans must seek to continue and substantially extend
this experience.
<p>
We should also devote special effort to meliorate, between the
space powers and others, the increasing gap in technological capability
and the gap in awareness and understanding of new opportunities
and responsibilities evolving in the space age.
<p>
If international participation and cooperation are to be expanded
in an important way, there will have to be (1) a substantial raising
of sights, interest and investment in space activity by the other
nations able to do so in order to establish a base for major contributions
by them; and (2) creation of attractive international institutional
arrangements to take full advantage of new technologies and new
applications for peoples in developing as well as advanced countries.
<p>
The most dramatic form of foreign participation in our program
will be the inclusion of foreign astronauts. This should be approached
in the context of substantive foreign contributions to the programs
involved.
<p>
The form of cooperation most sought after by advanced countries
will be technical assistance to enable them to develop their own
capabilities. We should move toward a liberalization of our policies
affecting cooperation in space activities, should stand ready
to provide launch services and share technology wherever possible,
and should make arrangements to involve foreign experts in the
detailed definition of future United States space programs and
in the conceptual and design studies required to achieve them.
We should consider three further steps:
<p>
The establishment of an international arrangement through which
countries may be assured of launch services without being solely
and directly dependent upon the United States.
<p>
A division of labor between ourselves and other advanced countries
or regional space organizations permitting assumptions of primary
or joint responsibility for certain scientific or applications
tasks in space.
<p>
International sponsorship and support for planetary exploration
such as that which was associated with the International Geophysical
Year.
<p>
[17] The developing countries will be most attracted to (l) applications
of space technology which serve their economic and social needs,
and (2) the development of international institutional arrangements
in which they can participate along with the advanced countries.
Some examples are:
<UL>
<Lem>Environmental studies and earth resource surveying via satellites;
<Lem>Direct broadcast via satellites of TV instructional and educational
programs;
<Lem>Expanding arrangements to acquire and use meteorological data;
<Lem>Training opportunities in space applications and space-related
disciplines.
</UL>

<p>
To the extent that future practical space applications are achieved,
there should be no significant technical obstacles to ensuring
the sharing of benefits on a global basis. There will, however,
be economic and political issues which require recognition and
effective anticipation.
<p>
In the case of the USSR, experience over the past ten years makes
clear that the central problem in developing space cooperation
is political rather than technical or economic. Numerous specific
technical opportunities for cooperation with the Soviet Union
have been identified and are available. Indeed, many of them have
been put to the Soviet Union in various forms through the years
with little success. For example, we could formulate a series
of graduated steps leading toward major cooperation. They would
range from full and frank exchange of detailed space project results,
at the lowest level, to prearranged complementary activities at
the next level (e.q., mutual support of tracking requirements,
coordinated satellite missions for specific tasks in space), and
ultimately to fully integrated prejects in which sub-systems could
be provided by each side to carry out a total space mission of
agreed character. The following possibilities merit serious consideration:
<p>
In space research -- earth orbital investigation of atmospheric
dynamics and Earth's magnetic field; astronomical observations
from earth satellites or lunar stations; satellite observation
of solar phenomena, and lunar and planetary exploration.
<p>
In practical applications -- coordination of a continuing network
of satellites to provide data for world-wide weather prediction
and early warning of natural disasters; the development of capabilities
for earth resource surveying via satellites.
<p>
In manned flight -- bio-medical research, space rescue, coordination
of experiments and flight parameters for Earth orbiting space
stations, lunar exploration, and exchange of astronauts.
<p>
In tracking -- to supplement each other's networks.
<p>
In view of the heavy commitment of the Soviets, planetary exploration
appears to offer unusual opportunities for complementary activities.
<h3>[19] IV. PROGRAM AND BUDGET OPTIONS</h3>

<p>
The Space Task Group was asked to provide &quot;definitive recommendation
on the direction the U. S. space program should take in the post-Apollo
period,&quot; through preparation of a &quot;coordinated program
and budget proposal.&quot; In the Section &quot;Goals and Objectives,&quot;
the Space Task Group has outlined the elements of this coordinated
program.
<p>
We have also pointed out that there are upper and lower bounds
to the Funding which will support a viable, productive and well
disciplined program. Between these bounds there are many options
both in program content and in total funding required. In this
section we will explore the range of these options and their resource
implications.
<p>
Clearly, there are a number of factors outside the space program
and the intrinsic merit of it; goals and objectives that must
be considered in determining the allocation of resources to the
program. Demands of other domestic programs, international conditions,
and state of economic health of our Nation are only a few of the
major influences upon the specific budget for space in a given
fiscal year.
<p>
Despite the highly variable nature of these influences, which
produces a corresponding increasing uncertainty in projections
of resource availability, it is important far planning purposes
to look into the future and forecast the general nature of funding
required to support decisions on content and pace of the program.
Two basic questions arise. Is the Nation to exploit its existing
capabilities, to expand those capabilities or reduce its participation
in space activity? Is funding for space generally to remain at
present levels, to increase dramatically or to decrease significantly
below present levels?
<p>
We stand at a crossroads, with many sets of missions and new developments
open to us and with three main avenues for funding to pursue these
opportunities.
<p>
To assist in answering these questions and to provide a basis
for Task Group analyses, NASA and DOD were each requested to prepare
a set of alternative proposals or options that would cover a range
of future resource levels and be consistent with the goals and
objectives recommended by the Task Group.
<H4>NASA Options</H4>

<p>
The range of resource levels considered by the Task Group for
NASA is shown in Figure 1.
<p>
(Graphic--see hard copy)
<p>
[20] These include: (l) an upper bound, defined by a a program
conducted at a maximum pace - limited, not by funds, but by technology;
(2) options I, Il, and III which illustrate programs consistent
with the Task Group recommendations, but conducted under varying
degrees of funding restraints; and (3) a low level program constructed
with an increased unmanned science and applications effort consistent
with the Task Group recommendations but, because of the significantly
lower budget levels, without a manned flight program after completion
of Apollo and Apollo Applications.
<p>
A comparison of the timing of major mission accomplishments under
the various programs is indicated in Table 1
<p>
(Graphic--see hard copy)
<p>
Although the program represented by the upper bound appears technically
achievable, would provide maximum stimulation to our over-all
capabilities, and is fully consistent with the Task Group recommendations,
it represents on initial rate of growth of resources which cannot
be realized because such budgetary requirements would substantially
exceed predicted funding capabilities. This has therefore been
rejected by the Space Task Group, and is presented only to demonstrate
the upper bound of technological achievement.
<p>
We have therefore developed a set of options which falls within
these limits to illustrate programs conducted at budget levels
which appear possible during the next decade.
<p>
Option I is illustrative of a decision to increase funding dramatically
and results in early accomplishment of the major manned and unmanned
mission opportunities, including launch of a manned mission to
Mars in the mid-1980's, establishment of an orbiting lunar station,
a 50 man earth-orbit space base and a lunar surface base. Funding
would rise from the present $4 billion level to $8-10 billion
in 1980. Decision to proceed with development of the space station,
earth-to-orbit shuttle and the space tug would be required in
FY 1971. Firm decisions [21] on other major systems or missions
would not be needed until later years; for example, a decision
to develop the Mars excursion module for an initial manned Mars
expedition would not be required before FY 1974.
<p>
Options II and Ill illustrate a decision to maintain funding initially
at recent levels and then gradually increasing. These options
are identical with the exception that Option Il includes a later
decision to launch a manned planetary mission in 1986 and in Option
III this decision is deferred. Both options demonstrate the effect
of simultaneous development of the Space Transportation System
and earth orbital space station module, each of which is expected
to require peak expenditure rates of the order of $1 billion per
year, and both options include a substantial increase in unmanned
science and applications from present levels but less than that
in Option I. Maintaining the unmanned program at the Option I
levels would require several hundred million dollars in additional
funding. Decision to develop both space station and earth-to-orbit
shuttle would be in about FY 1972, resulting in initial availability
of these systems in 1977. Similarly, other major milestones would
occur later, with decision on tne Mars Excursion Module estimated
for FY 1978. Funding for both options would remain approximately
level at $4 billion for the next two fiscal years and then would
rise to a peak of $5.7 billion in 1976 - this increase reflecting
simultaneous peak resource requirements of space station and space
shuttle developments. If these developments were conducted in
series, lower funding levels ($4-5 billion) could be achieved.
Option II would have a later peak of nearly $8 billion in the
early 1980's resulting from the manned Mars landing program. .
. .
<p>
[23] The lower bound chosen by the Space Task Group illustrates
a program conducted at significantly reduced funding levels. It
is our judgment that, in order to achieve these significantly
reduced NASA budgets, it would be necessary to reduce manned space
flight operations below a viable minimum level. Therefore, this
program has been constructed assuming a hiatus in manned flight
following completion of Apollo applications and follow-on Apollo
lunar missions. It thus sacrifices, for the period of such reduced
budgets, program objectives relating to development of new capability,
and the contribution of continuing manned space flight to several
of the other program objectives recommended by the Task Group.
It does, however, include a vigorous and expanded unmanned program
of solar system exploration, astronomy, space applications for
the benefit of man and potential for international cooperation.
Funding for such a program would reduce gradually to a sustaining
level of $2-3 billion depending upon the depth of change assumed
for the supporting NASA facilities and manpower base.
<p>
The Space Task Group is convinced that a decision to phase out
manned space flight operations, although painful, is the only
way to achieve significant reductions in NASA budgets over the
long term. At any level of mission activity, a continuing program
of manned space flight, following use of launch vehicles and spacecraft
purchased as part of Apollo, would require continued production
of hardware, continued operation of extensive test, launch support
and mission control facilities, and the maintenance of highly
skilled teams of engineers, technicians, managers, and support
personnel. Stretch-out of mission or production schedules, which
can initially reduce total annual costs, would result in higher
unit costs. More importantly, very low-level operations are highly
wasteful of the skilled manpower required to carry out these operations
and would risk deterioration of safety and reliability throughout
the manned program. At some low level of activity, the viability
at the program is in question. It is our belief that the interests
of this Nation would not be served by a manned space flight program
conducted at such levels.
<H4>DOD Options</H4>

<p>
A similar set of DOD Options, A through C, was constructed to
illustrate three basically different levels of military space
activity.
<p>
Three options are presented, not only to provide funding and program
options, but also to characterize the band of choices within which
a rational program of military space activities will evolve. Options
A and C are considered to be the upper and lower boundaries of
probable military space activity, with Option B being an example
of an intermediate level.
<p>
Option A presumes a future in which the threat to national security
could evolve in an increasingly hostile manner, thereby leading
to increased priorities for national defense and military space
activities. This option also provides for contingency efforts
designed to accommodate a high degree of uncertainty in future
international conditions. Cost effectiveness, technology availability,
growth rate of resource application, and national policy constraints
were considered in establishing this upper option for a full military
space capability.
<p>
[24] Option B includes those efforts necessary to counter the
known and generally accepted projections of the threat. In addition,
it provides limited developmental activities toward those capabilities
needed if the threat increases. Option B is a prototype program
which recognizes the need to minimize cost increases over the
next few years, but reflects the expectation that military space
activity will increase to provide the necessary support to our
military forces and posture. This option is consistent with national
and DOD policies and with Force Structure planning.
<p>
Option C is directly responsive to current national economic constraints,
and assumes that a lessening of world tensions will result in
reduced emphasis on national defense. It, therefore, includes
a lower level of system deployment than the other two options.
It still includes, however, the technology and support effort
necessary for contingency planning, together with those programs
now considered to be reasonable and predictable requirements.
Option C is the lower boundary of military space activity that
will meet existing national defense needs, although implied in
this option is a higher degree of risk than that inherent in Options
A and B. . . .
<H4>Program Flexibility</H4>

<p>
In the options submitted by NASA and DOD, resource requirements
have been projected which represent a large number of decisions
to be made in sequence over a number of years. Thus, the resource
projections represent the upper envelope or sum of funds required
to support these decisions. Many of these decisions are relatively
independent - that is, an earth orbit space station module can
be developed independently, without commitment to placing such
a station in orbit around the moon, or sending such a module on
a mission to Mars. In both of these examples, however, development
of the space station module would [25] be the normal first step
in achieving the lunar orbit station or Mars mission capability.
An example of the set of major program elements and hence decision
points inherent in the options described, based upon NASA Option
II, is included as Figure 6. A diversity of specific programs
with varying emphasis can be constructed by delaying or shifting
initiation of funding for these major elements relative to other
new developments.
<p>
There is, therefore, a great amount of flexibility inherent in
each of these options and adjustments to funding constraints may
be made on a yearly basis as part of the normal budget process.
Of course, once initiated, a specific major system development
profits from continuity in funding - stretchout or major fluctuations
in funding for a particular project generally increase the total
costs associated with it.
<p>
The levels of activity for the NASA and the DOD programs are essentially
independent, that is, selection of Options I or II for NASA could
be consistent with an Option A, B, or C level of activity for
DOD, since the DOD space activity will continue to be responsive
to national defense needs and will be determined on a case-by-case
basis under the budget and program established annually for the
Defense Department. It is important, however, that continued coordination
of the NASA and DOD programs and the effect of each agency's activity
on a common industrial and facility base receive authoritative
attention.<HR>
