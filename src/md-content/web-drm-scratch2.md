### Mozilla's position

Mozilla's position strikes me as very interesting and complicated. They have implemented DRM even though they are the opposoed to the concept of DRM. Acording to Brendan Eich:

> * Alternative browser vendors: CDMs are analogous to ActiveX components from the bad old days: different for each OS and possibly even available only to the OSâ€™s default browser.

Mozilla's Engineering team has worked with Adobe to create a blackbox that will talk to an Adobe CDM that will allow Firefox to play EME-protected content by providing the interface to a blackbox Adobe system.

In a [technical article in Mozilla Hacks](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/reconciling-mozillas-mission-and-w3c-eme/) Andreas Gal, at the time Mozilla CTO, explain the reasoning behind this policy and implementation.

My concern are the double standard at play here and the willingness of Mozilla to enter in this type of compromises, I see something similar to when Mozilla said [they wouldn't implement MP4 video in their browser](https://robert.ocallahan.org/2010/01/video-freedom-and-mozilla_23.html) in favor of open codecs and how they finally relented and sort of implemented a way to play MP4 video in Firefox.

If researchers were to look into the Adobe CDM module they would run afoul of the DCMA anti circumvention provisions which means that Mozilla, and all their users, have to trust a for profit company with a potentially big privacy and security aspect of their browser

But the reverse is not true. Researches, CDM vendors and other parties have free reign in inspecting and suggesting modifications to the open source code that interfaces with the CDM. In the end, Hollywood content producers have to be happy with the type of CDM and
