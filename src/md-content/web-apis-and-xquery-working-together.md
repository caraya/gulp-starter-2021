# Web APIs and xQuery working together

I'm starting to work with interviews. I would like to be able to get the audio transcribed to text and then store the text and the metadata about the interview in an no-sql/non-relational database that I can then query using either xQuery or regular web APIs

I'm researching different alternatives for a speech-to-text engine. The contenders are:

* [Google speech-to-text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/)
* [Microsoft speech-to-text](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/speech-api)
* [Amazon Transcribe](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/)
