# Punk Beer Web App

From: [5 Projects To Complete When Starting to Learn Front-End Web Development](https://medium.com/@GarrettLevine/5-projects-to-complete-when-starting-to-learn-front-end-web-development-48e8a1ce3178)

**Objective**: Use the punk beer api to create a unique project that uses templating to show data on the page. If you’re ambitious, use a front end framework like React.

Build the app in the following order:

* Template data on the page from a generic API request
* Add a search bar, which makes a separate query to a database on request
* Add favourite functionality which allows you to favourite a card
* Create a separate route (using react router) which allows you to see all the beers you’ve favourited in the session.

Solving these problems one step at a time will help you feel less overwhelmed and more like you’re heading in a specific direction.

Lastly, I find it best to eliminate styling from the equation when developing web apps and using a CSS framework. I chose to use Bulma for my example, but there are many options out there for you to explore!
