# The New Knowledge Navigator

In the early to mid 1980's Apple released the video below as a demo for future connected devices. The "knowledge navigator" was a device that could be used to navigate the world's knowledge and interact with all your devices.

I thought it was cute but until newer technologies like digital assistants (alexa, google assistant, etc) came along, it wasn't really feasible to create such a tool.

While it may still not be possible to create an agent as effective as the navigator, we may be able to duplicate some of its functionality.

Some of the areas that I want to take a deeper look at are:

* Assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant to see if it's possible to use them as the base for the project
* Speech synthesis using technologies like [WaveNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03499.pdf), if it is possible to do so
