March, 2020... 26 years and counting

Yup, it's that time of the year again... and it isn't.  I left Santiago March 26, 1994 in the overnight flight that was supposed to be Miami, Atlanta, Burlington VT (where the family was living at the time)... that what it was supposed to be but not what it ended up happening.

Oh, what an adventure that was and what an adventure it has been since.

They say that hindsight is 20/20 and can be a bitch of a judge but, you know what? I don't regret the decisions that got me where I'm at today. I may have at some points, whether I've admitted it or not.

Looking at the world as it is right now it feels so petty to write this and to feel anything but blessed to be healthy, alive and not have to worry about my direct family being sick with the bug.

In a way, it's starting to become a good time to think about legacies and, to my surprise, this is the song that came to mind when I started thinking about this.

I say to my surprise because this is one of my least favorite RUsh albums and one of my least favorite songs in that album.

```
In this one of many possible worlds
All for the best something are test
It is what it is and whatever
Time is still the infinite jest

The arrow flies when you dream
The hours tick away
The cells take away

Watchmaker keep to his steeds?
The hours tick away
They tick away

The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect
So hard to earn so easily burned
The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect
So hard to earn so easily burned
In the fullness of time
A garden to nurture and protect

In horizon to set of the sun?
To the stars goes spinning
Spinning 'round the night
Oh it is what it is and forever
Each moment of memory of light

The arrow flies while you dream
The hours tick away
The cells tick away
The watchmaker has time up his sleve
The hours tick away
They tick away

The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect
So hard to earn so easily burned
In the fullness of time
A garden to nurture and protect
(Its a measure of a life)
The treasure of a life is a measure of love and respect
The way you live the gifts that you give
And the fullness of time is the only return I do expect

The future dissapears into memory
With only a moment between
Forever dwells in that moment
Hope is what remains to be seen
Forever dwells in that moment
Hope is what remains to be seen

In the wholeness of time a garden to nurture and protect
(It's a measure of a life)
In the fullness of time a garden to nurture and protect
(It's a measure of a life)
In the wholeness of time a garden to nurture and protect
(It's a measure of a life)
In the fullness of time a garden to nurture and protect
(It's a measure of a life)
It's a measure of a life

The Garden
Rush (Clockwork Angels)

But it strangely resonated with me. It talks about legacies and that is starting to sound more like what I'm looking at.

It's a juxtapsition of where I am and where I want to be. Of working versus enjoying the rewards of that work and how you balance it.

It may sound ridiculous to you but being between 40 and 50 and tipping down towards the later it somewhat changes the perspective of things.

Can I still be passionate about what I do and how I do it? What would I do if I were to do something else? I think those are the questions that will dictate the year ahead.
