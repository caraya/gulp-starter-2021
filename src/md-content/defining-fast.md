# How do we define fast?

One thing that has struck me over the last few years is our obsession with fast. The faster, the better, right?

I've become interested on how do we define fast. Is a page that loads in 10 milliseconds instead of 5 slow? Is a page that shows you above-the-fold content in 150 miliseconds slow?

This became even more interesting in the context of this article from [gomakethings](https://gomakethings.com/javascript-selector-performance/) about performance in the context of selector speed.

So how fast is fast enough? Is there such a thing as too fast?

IF we take the [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) as an example, if a site takes 1.2 seconds to load in a fast 3G mobile connection, is it slow, even when it's not optimal? How do this absolute values relate to how users perceive speed?
