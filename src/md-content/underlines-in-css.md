# Underlines in CSS

CSS provides ways to play with the underline of elements beyond removing the underline from links and only showing it on hover.

[CSS Text Decoration Module Level 4](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-decor-4/) provides four longhand properties one shorthand property for underlining text.

This post will cover the `text-decoration-*` properties and some adjacent properties:

* The `text-decoration-skip-*` properties
* `text-underline-position`
* `text-underline-offset`

We will also discuss [When to Avoid the text-decoration Shorthand Property](https://css-tricks.com/when-to-avoid-css-text-decoration-shorthand/). Using the shorthand property is nice as it saves typing but it's not always the best option. The post explains when and why it may be a good idea to use the longhand properties.
