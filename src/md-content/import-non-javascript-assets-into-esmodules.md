# Import non Javascript assets into ES Modules

In [Importing JSON and CSS on Javascript](https://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/importing-json-and-css-on-javascript/) we discussed the ability to import CSS and JSON directly into Javascript using ESM syntax and [import assertions](https://v8.dev/features/import-assertions).

It is now possible to import JSON and CSS into a Javascript module to have some level of control over when they are processed.

We import CSS modules like this:

```js
import sheet from './styles.css' assert { 
  type: 'css'
};
```

And then have the option to add them to the document style sheet or to a custom element's shadow root.

```js
// Add the stylesheet to the host document
document.adoptedStyleSheets = [sheet];

// Add the stylesheet to a shadow root
shadowRoot.adoptedStyleSheets = [sheet];
```

Importing JSON content is done in a similar fashion:

We first import the JSON file with the proper type assertion and then we can then use the imported data in other scripts or templates.

```js
import http from 'http';
import config from './package.json' assert { type: 'json' };

http
  .createServer((req, res) => {
    res.write(`App name: ${config.name}\n`);
    res.write(`App version: ${config.version}`);
    res.end();
  })
  .listen(8080);
```

So why would we want to do this?

CSS and JSON modules have some of the same benefits as JavaScript modules.

* **Deduplication**: The file will only be fetched, instantiated, and parsed once, regardless of how many times itâ€™s requested
* **Consistent order of evaluation**: when the importing JavaScript is running, it can rely on the content it imports having already been fetched and parsed
* **Security**: modules are fetched with CORS and use strict MIME-type checking

JSON modules run on both Node.js and browsers (Chrome 91 and later) and CSS modules are supported in browsers (Chrome 93 and later)
