# Content outline


* Front Matter:
  * What this book is and what it's not.
  * It doesn't want to be a detailed combination of definitive guides but more like a combination of reference materials and guided exercises
* Introduction: What is the web and where do the component technologies come from?
* Part 1: The basics. The idea is to do a basic introduction to HTML, CSS and Javascript without digging too deep into tags, selectors or procedural versus functional programming. This will give the basics that we'll leverage in other parts of the tutorial
  * Chapter 2: HTML Basics
  * Chapter 3: CSS fundamentals
  * Chapter 4: Javascript Building Blocks
* Part 3: Digging deeper. Now that we have the basics we can start building things through more advanced content and exercises. This can also cover more advanced concepts or can go back to the basics and add details to them
  * Chapter 5: Crafting a layout
    * flexbox, tables and grids
    * exercise: Build a basic page. We'll revisit it later
  * Chapter 6: Making it pretty
