# Building applications with Astro

[Astro](https://astro.build/) provides an interesting take on using frameworks to create web content. It provides all the functionality of frameworks but the result is a static site that can be deployed to any web server.

What I like the most about Astro is that it will components from any framework (Preact, React, Svelte and Vue are the ones I'm familir with) along with an `.astro` format that is eclusive to the Astro build system and that we will discuss later in the post.

To create a new Astro application follow these steps:

```bash
npm init astro
npm install
npm start
```

This will create a new Astro application, install dependencies and start the development server.

Once the application is running we can make changes and they will be reflected on the page automatically.
