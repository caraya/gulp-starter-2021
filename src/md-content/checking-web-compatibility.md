# Checking web compatibility

When working with web content, it is important to check what browsers your content is compatible with.

There are three ways to do this:

[caniuse](https://caniuse.com) provides a basic compatibility table for most major desktop and mobile browsers.

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) goes a step further than Caniuse, it also provides additional information about the property, how it works and the specification that the property belongs to.

Both Caniuse and MDN require you to have a browser open on the right site and actively search for the property or API you're looking for.

MDN also provides its [browser compatibility data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdn/browser-compat-data) as an NPM package that you can use as the database for your own project or as a standalone library to query MDN browser compatibility data.
