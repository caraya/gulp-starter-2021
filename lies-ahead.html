  <h1 id="what-lies-ahead%2C-the-work-needed-and-not-becoming-complacent" tabindex="-1">What lies ahead, the work needed and not becoming complacent</h1>
<p>I will do my best to try and stay non-confrontational as I write this but it’s hard.</p>
<p>This time around, more so than in 2016, this is personal. As a Hispanic immigrant with a pre-existing condition I do have an ax to grind with people who voted for Trup then and now… but I’m not trying to grind the ax here.</p>
<p>As I said in an earlier post. The fight is over, now the work can begin. But what shape will that work take?</p>
<p>The fight for the 2020 elections is not quite over and what’s left will definitely have a short/medium term impact on everything.</p>
<p>We have two runoff elections in Georgia they too will represent the two sides of the political debate and will also dictate who controls the Senate come January 20.</p>
<p>Everyone is predicting that these races will be nasty as hell and will bring people and money from outside the state given, as Stacy Abrams says, the huge stakes involved.</p>
<p>I have no doubts that corporations will pour insane amounts of money into the two runoff elections. From companies that see Democrats as an existential threat to their existence to companies that are afraid that closing the loophole in the tax code will eat into their profits. So, as Dan Pfeiffer said in a recent issue of his newsletter, it’s corporations versus grass roots funding… who will win? News in January.</p>
<p>Starting with myself, if you’ve every wanted to be involved in the political process (and haven’t done so already) this is the perfect time to do it.</p>
<p>Let’s celebrate the accomplishment of the Biden campaing. Let’s pause to appreciate the huge organizing work that happened over the last four years that ended with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the White House.</p>
<p>Ok, now that we’ve drank the champagne and done the celebration, let’s look at the work ahead.</p>
<p>Biden will have a hell of a time on his first term regardless of who wins the runoff elections in Georgia, and not just from the GOP.</p>
<p>Biden will have the competing priorities of the moderate and the progressives within the Democratic Party and it’ll be hard to balance the conflicting priorities from those two sides of his own party.</p>
<p>How will McConnell and company obstruct government this time around if he remains majority leader? Will senators like Lindsey Graham, Lisa Muskorski, Susan Collins will actually work across the aisle or was it just political theater?</p>
<p>Outside partisan almost 71 million US elegible voters (70,818,286 to be precise at the time I wrote this) voted for Trump regardless of, or maybe because of, his policies and what he appeared to do for certain conservative and religious groups.</p>
<p>Whether it’s the anti-abortion catholic crowd or the ‘gay marriage over my dead body’ group, the second amendment at all cost militia or the ‘why should I pay for someone else’s health insurance’ get rid of the ACA healthy and greed party it pays to try to understand where they come from if we’re to get any sort of communication with them.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand this: “communication is a two-way street”. For meaningful dialogue to happen everyone involved has to be willing to listen and compromise; otherwise dialogue is not possible.</p>
