  <h1>Centering with Flexbox</h1>
<p>One of the most frustrating things for me is how to center things using CSS.</p>
<p>There are many ways to do it and everyone disagrees with everyone else. It is also true that there is no one-size-fits-all solution because what works with modern browsers doesn’t necessarily work in older versions.</p>
<p>That said, my favorite way to center content is using Flexbox.</p>
<p>For example, the code below will center its children both verticallly and horizontally on the available screen size (100vw by 100vh).</p>
<p>Because we’re using a right-to-left and top-to-bottom language we’ve set the direction to column, otherwise second and subsequent elements would appear next to each other.</p>
<p>We can choose whether to align vertically or horizontally and we can also choose the size of the area where we want to center content if using it as a standalone element.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.container {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  /* Vertical alignment*/
  align-items: center;
  /* Horizontal alignment */
  justify-content: center;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Using this code as a starting point we can experiment with what it would take to center content that is nested or inside grid cells.</p>
