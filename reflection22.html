<p>I find this post and event particularly relevant in light of my own anniversary and the rethinking of the decisions that brought me to today</p>
<p>Unlike Louie, this has a more immediate and gut wrenching feeling to me. Will my kids (if any) or my partner know Chile like I did, more, less. Do I ever know the Chile of today versus the Chille I know and the Chile I remember.</p>
<p>I was an an adult when I moved to the US and mom was already here... but it was a learning experience, not always fun but certainly a necessary one. It has forced me to grow and accept things that haven't always been on my list of things to deal with an accept.</p>
<p>&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:rebeccapurple;color:white;padding:1em 2em&quot;&gt;Subo al techo a ver el huracán
Y me senté a esperar
Y sin pensaar
Saco fuerzas de done no hay
Dejo mi mente en libertad
Vagabundear</p>
<p>Y, sin pensar — Miguel Mateos&lt;/pre&gt;</p>
<p>But things change and not always in ways you'd expect them to. I don't know if I was really ready to deal with Chile 5 years after I left... I don't know if I want to be ready to deal with Chile 24+ years after I left.</p>
<p>No, I don't regret the choice of leaving. I do question the choice of not returning. Part of me is at peace with the 20+ extra years I've spent in the US and part of me regrets the missed events and the missed friends.</p>
<p>As Neruda says in Poema 20: &quot;Nosotros los de entonces ya no somos los mismos&quot;, &quot;We of that time are no longer the same&quot;. I've reflected on how much and how differently we've all changed over the years. Those I knew when I was in high school and college have changed in ways I don't think I'd ever recognize today.</p>
<p>Weddings, children, moves, more children... there's a lot of things that I wasn't there for and I've always wondered how many of those things would have actually had an impact on my life growing up had I decided to go back?</p>
