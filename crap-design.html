  <h1 id="crap-in-design">CRAP in Design</h1>
<p>When working in Instructional and Presentation Design I remember the way were taught basic design, to think CRAP.</p>
<p>CRAP is the not very polite accronym for these four basic design principles</p>
<p>&lt;ul style=&quot;font-size: 250%; list-style-type: none;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contrast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-left: 10%&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repetition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-left: 20%&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alignment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;margin-left: 30%&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proximity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
<p>Why am I interested in these principles?</p>
<p>Whenever working on a presentation it's important to keep people engaged and tell a good story that will engage the audience. It will also let you move the content between formats: PowerPoint to Captivate and self-paced learning and to web presentations.</p>
<h2 id="the-principles">The Principles</h2>
<p>Now that we've looked at what the principles are and why I think thye are important, let's revisit them and talk about them in more detail. Along the way we'll look at</p>
<h3 id="contrast">Contrast</h3>
<p>In this context, contrast refers to any difference of size, shape, or color used to distinguish text.</p>
<p>The use of bold or italics is one common form of contrast; the difference in shape makes the bolded or italicized text stand out from the surrounding text.</p>
<p>Changing the size of our text or the font face we use for specific portions of the presentation (headings, subheadings, body text) is another way to create contrast.</p>
<p>One particular way to change the contrast is to change the foreground or text color and compare it with the background color. To be absolutely sure we have a good contrast ratio between the two colors we can use tools like Lea Verou's <a href="http://contrast-ratio.com/">contrast-ratio.com</a> or, if you're working on your browser, use Chrome DevTools color accessibility checker.</p>
<p>Font selection is another way to provide contrast for a slide or document. It can be through different fonts or it can be through different typefaces of the same font family.</p>
<h3 id="repetition">Repetition</h3>
<p>Repetition: Repetition in your text is bad; repetition of your design elements is not only good but necessary. Once you’ve decided on a size and typeface for an element then all instances of that element should look the same.</p>
<p>For most documents use a few, two or maybe three, fonts — leaning heavily on one for all the body text, with the other two for headers and maybe sidebars — are enough.</p>
<p>The same idea of repetition applies to other elements in your pages/slides such as bullets in lits, placement of information that is repeated in multiple pages/slides of your document, and design elements — like horizontal rules between sections or corporate logos.</p>
<p>Repetition of design elements pulls the document together into a cohesive whole, and also improves readability as it sets the reader's expectations about text that looks and quality (e.g. the start of a new section, a major point, or a piece of code).</p>
<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
<p>Alignment is crucial not just to the cohesive appearance of your document but to the creation of contrast for elements like bulleted lists or double-indented long quotes.</p>
<p>Your document should have a couple of vertical baselines and all text should be aligned to one of them.</p>
<h3 id="proximity">Proximity</h3>
<p>Pieces of information that are meant to complement each other should be near each other. Readers should be given a logical way to get to the next piece of information they need to see next.</p>
