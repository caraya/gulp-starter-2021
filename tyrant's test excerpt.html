  <p>But Luke and Eckels lingered, looking down on Maltha Obex as the vagabond, now a small thing in the distance, fell silent. Neither man spoke of his thoughts, but they shared a single mood of lingering awe and curiosity.</p>
<p>When Luke closed his eyes and began breathing in deep, slow waves, Eckels noted it without comment. But he was not wholly surprised when, a short time later, the vagabond disappeared completely from view.</p>
<p>“You have been practicing,” Eckels said, clapping Luke’s shoulder approvingly. “I confess I want to stay and document it all—most especially the day when the Qella begin to emerge. But this is best, to leave them alone. Tell me, what will you have done last?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how long it will last,” Luke said, gazing down on the planet. “Maybe not long at all. The forces affecting the ship are complex, and my teacher said that my touch is still too heavy. I had to try, though—try to draw the curtain and give them back their privacy, give them some time to heal, to build.” He looked toward Eckels. “But I want to come back, to meet them. I wonder how long we’ll have to wait.”</p>
<p>There was more than a touch of sorrow and regret in the archaeologist’s answering smile.</p>
<p>“Give them a hundred years,” Eckels said, knowing as he spoke that that meant he would never return to Maltha Obex. “Or a thousand. We will let this place stay on the charts as a dead, frozen world with nothing worth stealing or exploiting. The Qella will not miss us. Their lives will be full without us. You have given them a great gift, Luke – a future.” He looked out toward the pale white disc of the planet. “Somehow I know they will make the most of it.”</p>
