  <h1>Quick Note: Video Containers</h1>
<p>I was working on reecoding videos to HEVC from DVD contetnt I had ripped off before I lost access to a DVD player on my laptop. Yay, Apple. I couldn’t understand why the captions (in <code>.ass</code> format) would not render with the formatting they were created with.</p>
<p>A quick jump on the FFMPEG web chat made it clear that it was a veccontainer issue, not a caption or re-encoding one.</p>
<p><strong>Not all container formats support the same feature sets.</strong></p>
<p>Wikipedia’s <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Comparison_of_video_container_formats">Comparison of Video Containers</a> gives you an idea of the breadth and depth of the container fields out there.</p>
<p>This is different than the codecs that you use for audio and video. Both my favorite containers, Matroska with a <code>mkv</code> extension and MPEG4, with an <code>mp4</code> extension both support <code>hevc</code> for video and <code>acc</code> for audio. The big difference, at least according to people in the FFMPEG chat is that Matroska can handle captions where MPEG4 cannot.</p>
<p>Once again I’m reminded that whenever we work with video we need to be careful with formats, encoding laders, containers and a lot of other items before our users see any of the content we are working with.</p>
