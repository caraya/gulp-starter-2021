<p>Today it’s a double anniversary of sorts. Today it’s 27 years since I left Chile and tomorrow it’s 27 years since I arrived to the US… there was an overnight fly in between.</p>
<p>It’s still stamped solid in my mind… the huge immigration center in the Miami airport, thinking that because we made it there at 7am I would be in and out in an hour tops and the hundreds of people who were there ahead of me. How I lost all my connecting flights, how I learned that operators frown when you try to leave a voice mail on a collect call (if anyone remember what those are) and how the guys at the airline were beyond awesome on rebooking my flights so I could make it to Vermont… just not quite the way it was originally scheduled.</p>
<p>It has been one big adventure after another… with amazing people and things that if you had told me in '94 I would have done, I would have laguhed, pat your head and continued moving.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things that I want to do and places I want to see… there are things that I want to do that will reacquaint me with people and places I haven’t seen in a long time whether that’s 5 years or 30.</p>
