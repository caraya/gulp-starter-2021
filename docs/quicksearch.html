The biggest change this year is that I've switched to using gulp-libsquoossh instead of imagemin for image optimization. As a result there are now two Gulp tasks for image optimization: image:resize and image:compress. Another major and unexpected change is that node-sass is deprecated in favor of gulp-sass and the current dart-sass supported version. As a result the sass task has been modified to run with the new gulp-sass in synchronous mode. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.6.7 on 2021-08-15T09:50:02-07:00 using the DocStrap template.
