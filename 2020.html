  <h1>Transitions and Validations</h1>
<p>I’ve been listening to the American Idiot Broadway Soundtrack and it has triggered a lot of thinking and reflecting on what, where, how and, perhaps more importantly why.</p>
<p>There’s also the big question of whether I should actually commit and finish the unifished shit I have left.</p>
<p>In a way I’ve come to realize that the transitions and validations the title refers to never end because you’re never the same person, at least I hope I’ve continued to evolve and change for the better.</p>
<p>So let’s see what are the transitions and validations that I look forward in 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Work</strong>. Am I getting too old to keep the uncompromising position that my dad had before he passed away?</p>
<p><strong>Family and friends</strong>. I’m starting to learn who they are and who they are not. I’m surprisingly at peace with the choices I’ve made in this area but I need to make sure I validate them and that I’m happy with whatever comes out and how I validate things.</p>

<p><strong>Home</strong>. This is an interesting one and has two parts. The first one is whether I’d like to move back to live in Chile, where I haven’t lived for the past 25 years and where I’ve visited only once since I left.</p>
<p>But if Chile is not home then where is it.</p>

<p>A related question is who do I really know there. My dad passed away in 2002, my friends and I have grown in completely separate directions and when I was there 20 years ago I didn’t recognize the country or the few people I met with at the time (6 years after I had left)</p>
